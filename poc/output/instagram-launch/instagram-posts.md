## Post 1 — The Origin Story (Behind the scenes)

**Visual:** Screenshot of terminal/code running, or dark mode UI with agent outputs scrolling

I got tired of watching startups pay £5k-£15k for growth advice that boils down to "post more on LinkedIn."

So I built a system that runs 18 AI agents against your startup. Market sizing. Competitive positioning. Demand scoring. Channel analysis. Founder blind spots. Growth experiments with actual success thresholds.

It produces a diagnosis that most consultants would charge five figures for.

And it does it for £10.

Not a chatbot. Not a template. A full strategic teardown of your business.

More on this soon.

## Post 2 — Social Proof / Scale

**Visual:** Dark graphic showing "18 agents. 80+ data points. One diagnosis." with GrowthMind branding

What 18 AI agents analyse when they look at your startup:

→ Market demand scoring (0-100, six dimensions)
→ Competitive landscape mapping
→ Channel-by-channel deep dive
→ Founder blind spot detection
→ SWOT with actual evidence
→ Prioritised growth experiments
→ Strategic positioning

Takes consultants weeks. Takes us hours.

## Post 3 — Insight Post (LineLab data)

**Visual:** Stat graphic — "91/100 Competitive Differentiation. 58 LinkedIn followers."

We diagnosed a B2B SaaS company with Boeing, Hadrian, and GKN Aerospace as customers.

Their competitive differentiation score? 91 out of 100. Genuinely unique technology. No direct competitor.

Their LinkedIn followers? 58.

The product wasn't the problem. Distribution was. They were spreading across 5 verticals with no beachhead, and every deal was a custom pitch.

The diagnosis showed them exactly where to focus: one vertical, 5 reference customers, 6 months.

That's what a growth diagnosis does. Shows you what you can't see when you're inside the business.

## Post 4 — Educational (Common founder mistake)

**Visual:** Text post, bold statement

The most common mistake we see in growth diagnoses:

Founders who are ready to scale before they've proven the first market.

One company was planning franchise expansion. They had 4 bookings.

Another was selling across 6 industries. They had 58 LinkedIn followers.

A third had €1.7M in funding. Their website didn't explain what the product actually does.

Ambition is great. Sequencing matters more.

Prove one market. Then expand.

## Post 5 — Behind the Scenes (Building)

**Visual:** Screenshot of agent cascade / system architecture / data flowing

Building GrowthMind has been an exercise in restraint.

Every agent in the system has one job. The market intel agent doesn't do strategy. The competitive analyst doesn't do channel recommendations. The founder-mirror agent just looks at blind spots.

Then a strategist agent takes all 18 outputs and synthesises them into a coherent diagnosis.

It's the same logic a great growth consultant uses — except it doesn't have ego, it doesn't have pet frameworks, and it processes 80+ data points before forming an opinion.

Still early. Still improving. But the diagnoses are already catching things founders didn't know they were missing.

## Post 6 — Insight Post (Tiny Whirlwinds data)

**Visual:** Stat graphic — "Demand Score: 68/100. Instagram: 90 followers. Google presence: zero."

We ran a diagnosis on a baby sensory class business 2 weeks before launch.

Great product. Parents loved the trials. Dedicated studio with professional light shows. The only one in town.

The diagnosis found: no Google My Business profile. Instagram was 2 days old. No local partnerships. Zero visibility in every channel where their customers actually look.

Demand score: 68/100. The market was there. They just couldn't see it — because it couldn't see them.

Sometimes the most valuable insight is the most obvious one, delivered at the right moment.

## Post 7 — Educational (What founders get wrong about competition)

**Visual:** Text post or carousel

Your biggest competitor probably isn't who you think it is.

One company we diagnosed was worried about enterprise simulation giants. Their real competition? Spreadsheets and consultants.

Another thought they were competing with franchise baby classes. Their real competition? The Google search that returned zero results for their business.

A data governance startup was tracking 7 competitors. Their real blocker? Nobody could tell what they actually did from their website.

The diagnosis doesn't just map competitors. It identifies what you're actually losing to.

## Post 8 — Social Proof / What You Get

**Visual:** Mockup or screenshot of the diagnosis report (dark UI, sections visible)

What's actually in a GrowthMind diagnosis:

📊 Demand Scorecard — 6 dimensions, scored 0-100
🎯 Strategic Assessment — where you actually are vs where you think you are
🔍 Competitive Positioning — who you're really up against
📢 Channel Deep Dive — what's working, what's not, what to try
🧪 Growth Experiments — prioritised, with success thresholds and step-by-step instructions
🪞 Founder Mirror — the blind spots you can't see from inside

Delivered as a full written report. Not a dashboard. Not a summary.

A real strategic document you can act on.

## Post 9 — Insight Post (Qala data)

**Visual:** Stat graphic — "$20-30B TAM by 2030. Team: 1-10. No visible customers."

We diagnosed a data governance startup with €1.7M in pre-seed funding and a team that previously exited a company to a US acquirer.

The market is massive — $20-30B combined TAM by 2030. Every major competitor uses periodic snapshots. This startup's real-time approach is genuinely differentiated.

But the diagnosis revealed: no founder story on the website. No visible customers. Positioning too broad to cut through.

They were sitting on a regulatory gold rush (DORA, EU AI Act) and nobody could tell what they actually do.

Sometimes the gap between "great opportunity" and "great business" is just clarity.

## Post 10 — Behind the Scenes (Why £10)

**Visual:** Simple text or Tom to camera

"Why £10? Aren't growth consultants supposed to charge thousands?"

Yes. And most of them deliver a PDF you could've written yourself with a weekend of Googling.

£10 does three things:
1. It filters out people who aren't serious
2. It lets me prove the system works before charging more
3. It makes this accessible to founders who can't drop £5k on strategy advice

The diagnosis uses real data, real competitive analysis, and real market intelligence. Not templates.

If it's not worth 10x what you paid, I've failed.

## Post 11 — Educational (The beachhead problem)

**Visual:** Carousel — 3 slides

**Slide 1:** "The #1 strategic mistake early-stage startups make"

**Slide 2:** "Selling to everyone = selling to no one.

We see it in nearly every diagnosis:
→ 5+ verticals, no dominance in any
→ 'Our product works for everyone' (it doesn't)
→ Horizontal positioning with vertical buyers
→ Every deal is a custom pitch

Pragmatist buyers don't buy visions. They buy proven solutions with peer references in THEIR industry."

**Slide 3:** "The fix is simple (not easy):

Pick one segment. Go deep. Build 5 reference customers. Make the next 10 deals inevitable.

Then expand.

Geoffrey Moore wrote about this in 1991. Startups are still getting it wrong in 2026."
