# GrowthMind Case Studies

Real diagnoses. Real data. Real blind spots uncovered.

## 🔬 LineLab — "You have Boeing on the customer list and no idea how to get the next 10 deals."

**Company:** LineLab — analytical production system modeling (replaces discrete event simulation)
**Stage:** Early market, crossing the chasm
**Demand Score:** 80.5/100

**What they thought:** They had a world-class product with enterprise logos (Boeing, Hadrian, GKN Aerospace), MIT-validated methodology, and a 4.9x ROI for customers. Growth should follow naturally.

**What the diagnosis found:**

- **No beachhead.** LineLab was selling across aerospace, green tech, semiconductors, eVTOL, and advanced manufacturing simultaneously. Five verticals, zero dominance. Every deal was a custom pitch because there was no repeatable story.
- **Founder IS the sales team.** Every deal came through founder-led sales and MIT network effects. That's not a GTM strategy — that's serendipity with good product. It doesn't scale past ~10 deals/year.
- **58 LinkedIn followers.** A company with Boeing as a customer had less social presence than a local coffee shop. LinkedIn is THE channel for manufacturing decision-makers.
- **Invisible category.** A December 2025 academic review of 9 simulation tools didn't mention LineLab or analytical alternatives. The category literally doesn't exist in buyers' minds yet.
- **Competitive clock ticking.** Autodesk just acquired FlexSim. DES is consolidating around platforms. LineLab has 12-18 months to establish a beachhead before bundled simulation blurs their differentiation.

**The prescription:** Pick aerospace defense. You already have Boeing and GKN. Build 5 referenceable customers in 6 months. Stop chasing green tech startups. Every hour on a non-aerospace demo is an hour not spent dominating the one vertical that makes the next 50 deals inevitable.

**The number that matters:** 91/100 competitive differentiation score — genuinely unique methodology with no direct competitor. The product isn't the problem. Distribution is.

## 👶 Tiny Whirlwinds — "A brilliant product that nobody knows exists is a failed business."

**Company:** Tiny Whirlwinds — baby sensory classes in Farnham, Surrey
**Stage:** Pre-launch (2 weeks out)
**Demand Score:** 68/100

**What they thought:** They'd built Farnham's only dedicated sensory studio with professional light shows, tactile stations, and small groups. The class sells itself — parents loved the trials. Time to think about franchising.

**What the diagnosis found:**

- **Effectively invisible.** Instagram was 2 days old with 90 followers and 1 post. No Google My Business profile. No Happity listing. No local partnerships. Zero presence in the channels where Farnham mums actually discover baby classes.
- **Only 4 term bookings.** Needed 8-10 per class to feel viable, 12+ to be healthy. The product was validated by trial feedback — but nobody could find it.
- **Franchise ambitions before proving Farnham.** Planning multi-location expansion before filling the first studio. Classic founder trap — building the empire before building the army.
- **Solo operator, no backup plan.** One illness = cancelled classes = refunds + reputation damage. No substitute teacher. No assistant.
- **Marketing skill gap identified as existential.** The founder's #1 frustration was marketing. Tech background (co-founded a software company) but zero social media or local outreach experience. The product was great. The distribution was non-existent.

**The prescription:** Forget franchising. Get 20 new parents through the door in 30 days. Three actions: visit 5 local venues with leaflets this week, activate a bring-a-friend offer for existing parents, and post on Instagram 4x per week. Health visitors see EVERY new parent in the area — one recommendation is worth 100 Instagram followers.

**The number that matters:** 80/100 ICP clarity — crystal clear who the customer is (Farnham mums, 0-15 month babies, seeking gentle sensory). The founder IS her own ICP. The gap was purely visibility.

## 🔒 Qala — "You're sitting on a regulatory gold rush and nobody can tell what you actually do."

**Company:** Qala — source-level data observability and compliance platform
**Stage:** Pre-seed, €1.7M raised from QBIT Capital, Haatch, Backbone Ventures
**Industry:** Data governance / compliance infrastructure

**What they thought:** They had a technically differentiated product (real-time source-level data governance vs competitors' periodic snapshots), a strong founding team (previously built and exited Imburse Payments to Duck Creek Technologies), and massive regulatory tailwinds from DORA and the EU AI Act.

**What the diagnosis found:**

- **The website says everything and nothing.** CTAs are "Book a demo" with no signup flow, no public pricing, and no visible customers. The trust vacuum is the #1 growth blocker. At pre-seed with no customer logos, the site needs to work 10x harder — and it reads like enterprise software boilerplate.
- **No founder story anywhere.** Three co-founders who built and sold a payments company — and the website is completely impersonal. The Imburse origin story (what compliance nightmare made them build Qala?) is their strongest trust signal. It's missing entirely.
- **White space in source-level governance.** Every major competitor (Collibra at $5.5B valuation, BigID at $1.25B, OneTrust at $4.5B) uses scan-based or periodic snapshot approaches. Qala's real-time, source-level model is genuinely different — but the messaging doesn't make this distinction visceral. Buyers can't tell Qala apart from the incumbents.
- **Regulatory timing is perfect — if they move.** DORA went live January 2025. EU AI Act is phasing in. The data classification market is growing at 35.1% CAGR. But it's unclear if prospects are coming inbound from regulatory panic or if Qala is still educating the market. This determines the entire GTM playbook.
- **Targeting everyone in regulated industries.** Fintech, SaaS, healthtech, SMEs — the positioning is too broad for a team of 1-10. The beachhead question (200-person Swiss fintech vs 50-person healthtech?) is unanswered.

**The prescription:** Lead with the Imburse story. Make the source-level vs snapshot distinction the centrepiece of every piece of content. Pick one vertical (European fintech under DORA pressure is the obvious candidate). And get a real customer — even a design partner at reduced price — because at pre-seed, one logo changes everything.

**The number that matters:** $20-30B combined TAM across data observability, governance, and classification by 2030. Qala's serviceable market is $1-2B. The opportunity is enormous — but only if they can articulate why they're different from the $5.5B incumbents.
