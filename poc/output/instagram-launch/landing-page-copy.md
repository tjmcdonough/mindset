### For £10, we'll show you what they are.

## WHAT YOU GET

### A complete growth diagnosis, not a summary.

Every diagnosis includes:

**📊 Demand Scorecard**
Your market opportunity scored across 6 dimensions (0-100): problem urgency, market size, competitive differentiation, ICP clarity, willingness to pay, and market timing. You'll know exactly where your demand is strong and where it's weak.

**🎯 Strategic Assessment**
An honest evaluation of where you actually are — not where you think you are. Your stage, your real competitive position, and what needs to happen next. Includes a full SWOT backed by market data, not opinion.

**🗺️ Competitive Landscape**
Who you're really competing against (it might not be who you think). Positioning matrix showing when you win, when you lose, and how to differentiate. Includes competitor funding, revenue estimates, and recent strategic moves.

**📢 Channel Deep Dive**
Every acquisition channel assessed: what's working, what's underperforming, and what you haven't tried. Specific recommendations with tactics, not vague "improve your SEO" advice.

**🧪 Growth Experiments**
5-7 prioritised experiments with hypotheses, success thresholds, step-by-step instructions, effort estimates, and risk levels. These aren't ideas — they're executable playbooks ranked by impact.

**🪞 Founder Mirror**
The section most founders don't expect. An analysis of your blind spots, assumptions, and the gap between how you present your business and how the market sees it.

**Delivered as a full written report within 48 hours.**

## HOW IT WORKS

### Three steps. No calls. No forms.

**1. Pay £10 and submit your URL**
That's it. Your website, your LinkedIn, your product — we work with what's public. If you want to add context (stage, goals, challenges), there's a field for that.

**2. 18 AI agents go to work**
Market intel. Competitive analysis. Channel assessment. Demand scoring. Founder voice analysis. Strategic synthesis. Each agent has one job, and they do it without bias or pet frameworks.

**3. Your diagnosis lands in your inbox**
A full strategic report — typically 8,000-15,000 words — covering everything above. Within 48 hours of submission.

## REAL DIAGNOSES, REAL RESULTS

### What the system has already uncovered:

**LineLab** — B2B SaaS, production system modeling
Demand score: 80.5/100. Competitive differentiation: 91/100. The diagnosis found they were spreading across 5+ verticals with enterprise logos like Boeing — but no beachhead, no repeatable sales motion, and 58 LinkedIn followers. The product wasn't the problem. Distribution was.

**Tiny Whirlwinds** — B2C, baby sensory classes
Demand score: 68/100. Two weeks before launch with a great product and 4 bookings. The diagnosis found zero Google presence, an Instagram account that was 2 days old, and franchise ambitions before proving the first market. The prescription: 20 parents through the door in 30 days, not a franchise plan.

**Qala** — B2B, data governance, €1.7M pre-seed
Sitting on a $20-30B TAM with genuinely differentiated technology and a founding team with a successful exit. The diagnosis found: no founder story, no visible customers, and positioning too broad to cut through. The regulatory tailwind (DORA, EU AI Act) was massive — but nobody could tell what they actually do from the website.

## FAQ

**How long does it take?**
48 hours from submission. Most are delivered within 24.

**What do you need from me?**
Your website URL. That's the minimum. You can optionally add: your stage, what you're struggling with, your goals, or anything else you think is relevant. The more context, the sharper the diagnosis.

**Is this just ChatGPT with a wrapper?**
No. GrowthMind runs 18 specialised AI agents in sequence — market intelligence, competitive analysis, founder voice analysis, demand scoring, channel assessment, strategic synthesis, and more. Each agent has a specific job and produces structured output that feeds the next. The final diagnosis is synthesised by a strategist agent that weighs all inputs. It's closer to a consulting engagement than a chatbot conversation.

**What kind of startups is this for?**
Any stage, any industry. We've diagnosed pre-launch businesses, funded startups, and established companies with enterprise customers. The system adapts to what it finds. That said, the diagnosis is most valuable for early-to-growth stage companies trying to figure out where to focus.

**Will you share my data?**
No. Your diagnosis is private. We may use anonymised, aggregated patterns to improve the system, but your specific business data is never shared. If we want to reference your company (like the case studies above), we'd ask first.

**What if the diagnosis isn't useful?**
It's £10. But in every diagnosis we've run, the system has surfaced at least one significant insight the founder didn't have. If yours is the exception, email me and I'll refund you. No questions.

**Can I ask follow-up questions?**
The £10 diagnosis is a standalone report. If you want to go deeper — a strategy session, ongoing advisory, or a custom deep-dive — we can talk about that after you've read the report.

**Who's behind this?**
Tom McDonough. I've spent years working with startups on growth strategy and got frustrated watching founders pay thousands for generic advice. GrowthMind is what happens when you apply AI agents to the problem properly — not as a gimmick, but as a genuine analytical system.
