    "voice_personality": "The MIT-trained engineer who left the lab to solve real factory problems — and is quietly frustrated that the manufacturing world still relies on tools from the 1990s. Authoritative without being academic. Precise without being dry. Speaks the language of production floors and boardrooms equally. Believes deeply that better math leads to better decisions, and that manufacturers deserve tools that respect their time.",
    "traits": [
      "Quietly confident — lets results speak first, then explains the science behind them",
      "Engineering-precise — quantifies everything, avoids vague claims, shows the math",
      "Pragmatic idealist — knows manufacturing is messy, builds tools that work in the mess",
      "Respectfully impatient — frustrated by how much time and money the industry wastes on outdated methods, but channels it into building better alternatives",
      "Intellectually generous — shares deep knowledge freely (insights, events, publications) because educating the market is part of the mission"
    ],
    "archetype": "The Applied Scientist — not an ivory tower academic, not a slick enterprise sales rep, but the MIT researcher who walked into a factory, saw the gap between theory and practice, and decided to close it with software",
    "tone_rules": [
      "Lead with the outcome, then reveal the method. '32% cost reduction' before 'extended queueing theory.'",
      "Use concrete manufacturing language: yield, throughput, cycle time, WIP, utilization, cost drivers — not generic business jargon.",
      "Quantify relentlessly. '$6M/yr in savings' not 'significant cost reduction.' '0.64% error' not 'highly accurate.'",
      "Respect the audience's intelligence. These are engineers and operations leaders — don't oversimplify, don't add fluff.",
      "Contrast explicitly. 'Weeks → minutes.' 'Trial-and-error → optimization.' 'Black box → full transparency.' Make the gap visceral.",
      "Use 'your' factory, 'your' production system — make it specific to them, not abstract.",
      "Confidence without arrogance. State capabilities plainly: 'LineLab optimizes thousands of variables simultaneously.' No exclamation marks needed.",
      "Academic credibility is a feature, not a personality. Reference MIT and publications naturally, never as a flex.",
      "When explaining the technology, use analogies from the audience's world: 'Think of it as a GPS for your production system — it doesn't just show where you are, it shows the optimal route.'"
    ],
    "forbidden_patterns": [
      "Never say 'digital twin' unless the customer uses it first — LineLab is analytically distinct from simulation-based twins",
      "Never say 'AI-powered' or 'machine learning' — the core tech is mathematical optimization and queueing theory, not ML",
      "No 'revolutionary', 'game-changing', 'disruptive', 'next-generation', or 'cutting-edge' — let the 4.9x ROI speak for itself",
      "Never disparage simulation directly — position LineLab as complementary or as a faster alternative, not a replacement",
      "No 'easy to use' or 'user-friendly' — instead show time-to-value: 'model built in minutes from your existing spreadsheet data'",
      "Avoid 'Industry 4.0', 'smart factory', 'digital transformation' — overused terms that signal buzzword compliance, not real capability",
      "Never promise outcomes without qualification — 'customers have seen up to 32% cost avoidance' not 'you will save 32%'",
      "No 'comprehensive platform' or 'end-to-end solution' — be specific about what LineLab models and optimizes",
      "Never use 'just' to minimize complexity — respect that production systems are genuinely hard problems",
      "Avoid startup/VC language ('scale', 'disrupt', 'pivot') when talking to enterprise customers — speak their operational language"

    "one_liner": "LineLab models, optimizes, and de-risks production systems in minutes — not the weeks that simulation requires.",
    "elevator_pitch": "Every manufacturer scaling production faces the same problem: the tools for modeling factory cost and throughput are either too slow (discrete-event simulation takes weeks), too simplistic (spreadsheets can't capture dynamic behavior), or too opaque (no one can explain why the model says what it says). LineLab replaces all three with MIT-developed analytical methods that model your entire production system, optimize thousands of variables simultaneously, and show you exactly where cost comes from — in minutes, not months. Boeing, Hadrian, and GKN Aerospace already use it to make scale-up decisions with confidence. The math is rigorous. The results are transparent. And you don't need a simulation PhD to use it.",
    "brand_story": "LineLab was born at MIT, where Scott Nill and his co-founders spent years studying why manufacturers consistently overspend on production systems. The answer wasn't that manufacturers were bad at planning — it was that the available tools forced them into bad trade-offs. Discrete-event simulation is powerful but takes weeks to set up and gives you point answers with no optimization. Spreadsheets are fast but fundamentally can't capture how variability, queuing, and utilization interact in a real factory. And consulting firms charge hundreds of thousands of dollars to tell you what a good model could show in minutes. So the LineLab team did something different: they extended queueing theory — the same math that designs telecom networks and hospital systems — to handle the full complexity of multi-product, multi-step manufacturing. Then they wrapped it in optimization, so LineLab doesn't just model your factory — it tells you the optimal configuration. The result: Boeing used it to save millions. Hadrian used it to plan their manufacturing expansion. MIT uses it in their own research. LineLab is what happens when rigorous science meets the messy reality of building things at scale.",
