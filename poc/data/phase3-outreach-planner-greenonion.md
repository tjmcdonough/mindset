# Phase 3.6: Outreach Planner — GreenOnion

## Outreach Context
This is an outbound prospecting plan for reaching Nikos Fertakis (founder). The goal is to provide genuine value and establish a growth advisory relationship.

## Outreach Strategy

### Channel: Email or Twitter DM
- **Email:** Likely findable via nikosfertakis.com or nfertakis@ pattern
- **Twitter:** @nikosfertakis (but appears low-activity)
- **HN:** Could reply to his Show HN post (public, builds credibility)

### Recommended Approach: "Research-Led Value Drop"

**Why this works for this founder:**
- Nikos is analytical (Papers We Love, ML background)
- He's asking for feedback publicly (HN post invites it)
- He values substance over hype
- He has specific questions (pricing, defensibility, focus)

### Message Framework

**Subject/Hook:** "Your GreenOnion pricing analysis (you're leaving $X on the table)"

**Key elements:**
1. Reference the HN post specifically — shows you found him naturally
2. Lead with ONE concrete, actionable insight (pricing is the strongest)
3. Show you've done real research (mention Ecomtent's $510/mo as proof point)
4. Answer one of his explicit questions (defensibility or pricing)
5. Light CTA: "Happy to share the full analysis if useful"

### Outreach Draft

> Hi Nikos,
>
> Saw your Show HN on GreenOnion — the "zero prompts" approach to Amazon listing images is smart positioning.
>
> You asked about pricing on HN. Quick data point that might help: Ecomtent.ai charges $510/mo for 25 SKUs. You're charging $149/mo for 125 generations. That's a ~20x pricing gap for arguably a better UX (zero-prompt vs. prompt-required).
>
> On the "just prompts" defensibility concern — Jasper.ai was also "just prompts" and hit $1.5B valuation. The moat isn't the API calls, it's the workflow reliability (95%+ usable is genuinely hard to achieve) and the domain-specific quality curation. Your Skroutz background gives you a real edge here.
>
> I've put together a deeper analysis of your market position, pricing, and growth channels if you're interested. No pitch — genuinely think you're onto something and the pricing question is the easiest win.

### Timing
- Best sent: Weekday morning Athens time (10-11 AM EET)
- Follow-up: 5 days later if no response
- Alternative: Reply publicly to HN post with pricing insight (builds public credibility)

### Objection Handling
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Who are you?" | "We analyze growth strategies for early-stage tools. Found you on HN." |
| "I don't need help" | "Totally fair. The pricing data point is yours either way." |
| "How much does this cost?" | "Let's start with a conversation. If there's a fit, we can discuss." |
| "I'm too early for this" | "9 customers with emotional PMF is exactly when this matters most — before you scale with wrong pricing." |
