# Phase 2: Pre-Interrogation Questions — GreenOnion

## MODE: Pre-Interrogation (Outbound Prospecting)
All questions below are designed to UNLOCK HIGHER CONFIDENCE on inferred data points. These would be asked in a discovery call or initial conversation with the founder.

---

## Category 1: Unit Economics & Business Model
*[UNLOCK: Confident pricing and growth recommendations]*

1. **What's your cost per generation?** (API costs for the full 9-image pipeline)
   - *Why:* Need to understand margins before recommending price increases. If cost is $0.50/generation, there's massive room. If $5, less so.
   - *Current inference:* ~$0.30-1.00 per generation [INFERRED — unknown]

2. **What's your free-to-paid conversion rate?**
   - *Why:* 9 paying customers tells us nothing without knowing how many tried the free tier.
   - *Current inference:* Unknown. Could be 9/20 (amazing) or 9/500 (terrible).

3. **Are customers on monthly or have any churned?**
   - *Why:* At 1 month old, too early for churn data, but important baseline.
   - *Current inference:* Likely all retained (only 1 month in) [INFERRED]

4. **What tier are most customers on?**
   - *Why:* If 8/9 are on $19 Creator, very different from 8/9 on $149 Enterprise.
   - *Current inference:* At least one on Enterprise ($149) — first customer [CONFIRMED]

## Category 2: Product & Technical
*[UNLOCK: Defensibility assessment and roadmap advice]*

5. **Which AI models are you using in the pipeline?** (Image generation, text, analysis)
   - *Why:* Dependency risk assessment. If reliant on one provider (e.g., OpenAI), single point of failure.
   - *Current inference:* Multi-model (GPT-4V + image gen model) [INFERRED]

6. **What does the 5% failure rate look like?** What makes an output "unusable"?
   - *Why:* Understanding failure modes reveals product improvement priorities.
   - *Current inference:* Unknown

7. **How do outputs vary by product category?** Does it work better for some products than others?
   - *Why:* Category-specific performance determines niche-down vs. broad strategy.
   - *Current inference:* Unknown — critical gap

8. **Are you tracking which generated images sellers actually USE vs. discard?**
   - *Why:* This data becomes your moat. If you know which layouts convert, you can optimize.
   - *Current inference:* Likely not yet [INFERRED]

## Category 3: Customers & Market
*[UNLOCK: ICP definition and go-to-market strategy]*

9. **Who are your 9 customers?** (Seller size, product category, Amazon/Etsy/Shopify split)
   - *Why:* Pattern-matching on ICP. If all are Amazon private label with 20-50 SKUs, that's your beachhead.
   - *Current inference:* Likely Amazon-focused, small-to-mid sellers [INFERRED]

10. **How did they find you?** (HN, Google, referral, social?)
    - *Why:* Knowing acquisition channel determines where to double down.
    - *Current inference:* Likely HN + organic [INFERRED]

11. **The customer who "wanted to cry" — can you tell us more?** What was she doing before? How many products? What did she try?
    - *Why:* This is your best marketing story. Need the full narrative.
    - *Current inference:* She struggled with image creation for months [CONFIRMED from HN]

12. **Have any customers given you conversion data?** (Before/after listing performance)
    - *Why:* "33% conversion increase" on the website is generic research. Real customer data is 10x more convincing.
    - *Current inference:* No real conversion data yet [INFERRED]

## Category 4: Strategy & Vision
*[UNLOCK: Strategic advisory positioning]*

13. **Is GreenOnion a side project or are you planning to go full-time?**
    - *Why:* Advice differs massively. Side project = optimize for cash flow. Full-time = optimize for growth.
    - *Current inference:* Side project alongside Skroutz Head of Product role [INFERRED]

14. **What made you reposition to ecommerce specifically?**
    - *Why:* Understanding the pivot reason reveals market insight and conviction level.
    - *Current inference:* Found product-market fit signal after trying broader approach [INFERRED]

15. **Do you have a runway / budget for growth?** (Bootstrapped? Any funding plans?)
    - *Why:* Determines whether to recommend paid acquisition or organic-only.
    - *Current inference:* Bootstrapped, limited budget [INFERRED]

16. **What does success look like for you in 6 months?**
    - *Why:* Aligns advisory to founder's actual goals, not assumed ones.
    - *Current inference:* Unknown

## Category 5: Competition Awareness
*[UNLOCK: Competitive strategy]*

17. **Are you aware of Ecomtent ($510/mo)?** How do you see yourself vs. them?
    - *Why:* If unaware, this validates our pricing recommendation. If aware, need to understand positioning choice.
    - *Current inference:* May not be aware of direct competitor pricing [INFERRED]

18. **Have you looked at Pic Copilot (Alibaba's free tool)?**
    - *Why:* Free competitor backed by Alibaba is a real threat. Need founder's take.
    - *Current inference:* Unknown

19. **Any sellers mention trying other AI tools before GreenOnion?**
    - *Why:* Switch motivation reveals true value proposition from customer's perspective.
    - *Current inference:* Unknown
