        "Founder identified real pain: clients forced to download apps to book appointments",
        "Reddit threads confirm barbers complain about Fresha/Booksy UX and customer support",
        "No-shows are the #1 pain point for barbers — booking friction contributes to this",
        "r/smallbusiness and r/Barber have active threads asking for better booking tools"
      ],
      "reasoning": "The problem is real but not hair-on-fire. Barbers cope with existing tools — Fresha is free and 'good enough' for most. The specific pain of 'forced app downloads' is genuine but niche. Most barbers' bigger pain is no-shows and getting new clients, not the booking tool itself. Score reflects a real but not urgent problem in a market with many adequate solutions."

    "market_readiness": {

        "Salon booking software market at $518M growing 6.7% CAGR",

        "Gen Z barbers expect modern mobile-first tools",
        "Booth rental model growing — independent barbers need their own lightweight tools"
      ],
      "reasoning": "Market is ready and growing. Conditions are right for modern booking tools. However, readiness also means the market is already well-served. This isn't an emerging category — it's mature with established players. The opportunity is in underserved niches within a served market."

        "No unique technology, patents, or methodology — booking tools are commodity software",
        "Brand name 'Timber' creates SEO confusion with lumber industry",
        "Not listed on ANY software directory (G2, Capterra, GetApp, Product Hunt)",
        "Zero social proof — 1 user, 0 paying, no testimonials"
      ],
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest dimension by far. Timber has no defensible competitive position. The product does not appear to have any technical moat. The one genuine differentiator ('no app download for clients') is a feature, not a moat — any competitor could replicate it in a sprint. Competing against free (Fresha) and $160M-funded (SQUIRE) with zero resources, zero brand, and a confusing name is an extremely difficult position."

        "No evidence of domain expertise in beauty/wellness"
      ],
      "reasoning": "The founder can build product but shows no evidence of understanding the barber industry from the inside. In a market where trust and peer recommendations drive adoption, having no industry connections is a major handicap. The choice to outreach on Reddit rather than Facebook groups reveals a SaaS-founder mindset, not a barber-industry mindset."

      "score": 20,
      "evidence": [
        "Solo founder — 1 person vs competitors with teams of 50-500+",

        "1.5+ months post-launch with 0 paying customers suggests execution challenges",
        "No marketing, sales, or design expertise evident"
      ],
      "reasoning": "A solo, likely part-time founder with no funding competing in one of the most crowded SaaS verticals is an extreme execution challenge. The SPA architecture mistake suggests gaps in web marketing knowledge. There's nothing wrong with being solo and bootstrapped — but the ambition (competing with Fresha, SQUIRE, Square) requires resources that aren't available."

      ],
      "reasoning": "Timber has effectively zero distribution. The product is invisible to its target market. The founder is doing outreach in the wrong places. The website can't be found via search. There's no social proof, no directory listing, no community presence where barbers actually are. This is the #1 problem to solve."

    "score_method": "Weighted average — Problem Severity and Distribution Advantage at 1.5x weight",
    "score_interpretation": "A score of 30/100 indicates severe structural challenges. This is not a reflection of the founder's effort or the product's quality — it's a reflection of the competitive dynamics, distribution position, and resource constraints. The score would improve significantly with: (1) evidence of product-market fit from real users, (2) any distribution channel showing traction, (3) a clear niche positioning that avoids head-on competition with funded incumbents."

  "verdict": {
    "decision": "CONDITIONAL",
    "reasoning": "Timber has a working product and an identified (though common) pain point, but faces extreme structural challenges: a saturated market with free/well-funded competitors, zero distribution, a confusing brand name, and a solo founder with no industry connections. The product itself may be good — we can't fully assess without real user feedback — but the go-to-market position is critically weak. A growth programme would be premature without first validating that barbers will actually choose Timber over free alternatives when presented with it face-to-face.",
    "conditions": [
      "CONDITION 1: Validate demand through 20 face-to-face barbershop demos within 30 days. If fewer than 5 barbers sign up for a free trial after a live demo, the product or positioning needs fundamental rework before any growth investment.",
      "CONDITION 2: Get specific, documented feedback from the existing free users. What do they love? What's missing? Would they pay? If they wouldn't pay, that's a critical signal.",
      "CONDITION 3: Make a decision on the brand name. Either commit to 'Timber' and accept the SEO penalty, or rebrand before building any marketing assets.",
      "CONDITION 4: Fix the SPA rendering issue OR accept that SEO is permanently off the table and build a 100% direct-sales strategy."
