**Date:** 2026-02-13 | **Status:** PRE-INTERROGATION (questions generated, not yet asked)

---

## Critical Priority

### 1. How much time per week are you spending on Revenue Boost — full-time or alongside other work?
**Why:** A 10hr/week side project gets a fundamentally different growth strategy than a full-time commitment. Your experiment capacity, outreach cadence, and timeline expectations all depend on this.

### 2. What's your monthly budget for Revenue Boost — hosting, messaging infrastructure (Twilio/WhatsApp API costs), marketing? How many months of runway?
**Why:** Your per-message pricing model means YOU pay for message delivery infrastructure. At what point does message volume become profitable? We need to model unit economics.

### 3. Have you onboarded even a single test store — even your own? What does the actual merchant experience look like end-to-end?
**Why:** Your website claims "Loved by 15,000+ Merchants" with named testimonials (Sarah Mitchell, James Chen, etc.). These appear to be fabricated. If discovered by a potential user, this instantly destroys trust. We need to understand the decision behind this.

### 4. The website testimonials — are these real merchants or placeholder content? "Sarah Mitchell, Founder, Luxe Boutique" and "James Chen, Marketing Lead, TechGear Pro" — can you verify these?
**Why:** This is a CRITICAL trust issue. Fake testimonials on a zero-user app will be discovered. Shopify merchants are savvy — they Google reviewer names. This could sink the entire business if flagged in an App Store review.

### 5. What's your actual messaging infrastructure? Are you using Twilio for SMS, WhatsApp Business API directly, or a third-party aggregator? What are your per-message costs?
**Why:** The "pay per message" model's viability depends entirely on your cost structure. If you're paying $0.05/SMS and charging $0.03, the model is inverted. We need real numbers.

## High Priority

### 6. Why did you build so many features before launching? Popups + spin wheels + scratch cards + cart recovery (4 channels) + A/B testing + OTP verification + social proof + free shipping bar + identity reconciliation — this is the feature set of a 3-year-old product.
**Why:** Over-building before launch is a classic technical founder pattern. Was there a strategic reason, or was it scope creep? Understanding this helps calibrate future build-vs-distribute recommendations.

### 7. Have you applied for Shopify's "Built for Shopify" badge? Do you meet the technical requirements?
**Why:** This badge significantly impacts App Store visibility and merchant trust. If you're close to qualifying, it should be priority #1.

### 8. Who is BCDI SNC? Is this a company you own, or are there co-founders/partners?
**Why:** The company registration is in Belgium. Understanding the entity structure clarifies decision-making speed, resources, and legal capabilities (especially for GDPR compliance with WhatsApp/SMS messaging).

### 9. What's your pricing actually? The App Store says "Free plan available, Free trial available" but doesn't show tier prices. What are the per-message rates?
**Why:** We can't assess competitive pricing position without knowing actual prices. The Shopify listing is incomplete.

### 10. Have you contacted any Shopify agencies or partners about recommending Revenue Boost?
**Why:** Agency partnerships are the #1 growth lever for Shopify apps at your stage. One agency relationship = 10-50 installs.

## Medium Priority

### 11. What's your technical architecture? Is the app embedded or standalone? How does it impact store speed?
**Why:** Store speed impact is a top concern for Shopify merchants. "Zero slowdown" is a strong claim — can you back it with data?

### 12. Do you have any analytics on your website traffic — where are the Google Ads 15 views coming from, what keywords?
**Why:** Even tiny traffic data reveals intent signals we can amplify.

### 13. What made you choose the per-message pricing model? Did you validate this with merchants, or is it your hypothesis?
**Why:** The pricing model is your key differentiator. If it's validated by merchant feedback, it's a real moat. If it's a guess, it needs testing.

### 14. Are you aware of the competitive density in this space? The "More apps like this" section on your listing shows apps with 63-440+ reviews. How do you plan to compete?
**Why:** Understanding the founder's competitive awareness helps calibrate strategic recommendations.

### 15. What's your plan for the next 90 days? What are you prioritising?
**Why:** Alignment between our recommendations and founder priorities determines implementation likelihood.

**Current confidence:** 32%
**Post-interrogation estimate:** 60-70%
**Critical unlock:** Questions 3-5 (fake testimonials, infrastructure costs, actual product experience) would most dramatically change our assessment.
