# Phase 3.4: Founder Mirror — Nikos Fertakis / GreenOnion

## Founder Archetype: The Technical Craftsman
Nikos is a builder first, marketer second. He's the type who finds the "fine line" in AI outputs through patient experimentation, not the type who ships fast and iterates on messaging. This is both his strength (product quality) and his constraint (growth speed).

## Psychological Profile [INFERRED]

### Strengths as a Founder
- **Deep technical competence** — ML background (UCL), systems engineering (Skroutz)
- **Domain expertise** — works at a marketplace daily, understands seller needs
- **Intellectual honesty** — openly discusses weaknesses (HN post: "just prompts," pricing uncertainty)
- **Quality orientation** — "95%+ usable" suggests high standards
- **Community native** — Papers We Love, HN, tech community

### Potential Blind Spots
- **Underpricing as imposter syndrome** — "$149 for a $3K problem" but won't raise prices. Classic technical founder pattern: valuing the work less because "it's just prompts."
- **Defensibility anxiety** — worrying about moats when he should be worrying about growth. At 9 customers, the moat question is premature.
- **Analysis paralysis risk** — "stay ecommerce or expand?" is a question for 100+ customers, not 9.
- **Solo founder + day job = bottleneck** — may be using GreenOnion as a "safe" side project that never requires the scary leap to full-time.
- **Potential underestimation of distribution** — strong product builders often assume the product will sell itself.

## Founder-Market Fit: 8/10
- Skroutz (marketplace product leader) → ecommerce seller tool = excellent alignment
- ML background → AI product = natural technical fit
- Greece location → US Amazon seller market = slight geographic mismatch
- Solo founder → fast-growing competitive market = resource mismatch

## Communication Style
- Responds to: data, logical arguments, peer-level technical discussion
- Less responsive to: hype, aggressive sales tactics, "crush it" culture
- Best outreach approach: intellectual peer, "I analyzed your business and found X" — respect for his intelligence

## Key Insight for Engagement
Nikos needs to hear from someone he respects (technically) that:
1. His product is more defensible than he thinks
2. His pricing is leaving money on the table
3. The "just prompts" framing is self-sabotaging
4. He needs to choose: side project or real business (and either is fine)

The "Papers We Love" co-host detail suggests he values rigorous analysis. Lead with data, not enthusiasm.
