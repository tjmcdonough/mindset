  "summary": "Scan of 10 Reddit subreddits over the past 24h yielded 7 signals, 2 high-value. Today's signal volume was moderate — the SaaSpocalypse macro event (AI disrupting SaaS stocks) dominated Reddit SaaS discussion, somewhat drowning out individual founder pain posts. Top signal: a SaaS founder on r/SaaS who burned money on paid ads and is now seeking agency help (sig_001, score 88) — perfect Growthmind ICP match. Second: an r/Entrepreneur founder stuck for years with a polished product that won't grow (sig_002, score 85) — classic PMF limbo. Key pain themes: wasted ad spend, growth stagnation, and technical founders who can build but can't market. Recommended priority: engage sig_001 and sig_002 within 12 hours with value-first comments positioning Growthmind's diagnostic approach as an alternative to expensive agencies and aimless iteration.",
  "notes": "API rate limiting (Brave Search free tier: 1 req/sec) constrained search volume. Ran 14 queries total. Many queries returned zero results for the 24h window — Reddit's daily volume of ICP-matching pain posts is naturally low. The SaaSpocalypse news event ($285B SaaS market wipeout on Feb 3) dominated SaaS-related search results. Consider upgrading Brave API plan for higher throughput in future scans."
