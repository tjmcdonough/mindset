# Phase 1.6: Channel Finder — GreenOnion

## Distribution Channels (Ranked by Expected Impact)

### Tier 1: High Impact, Low Cost

1. **Reddit (r/FulfillmentByAmazon, r/AmazonFBA)**
   - Post genuine results, offer free generations
   - The Photoroom thread proves sellers discuss AI image tools here
   - Risk: Reddit hates self-promotion. Must be value-first.

2. **YouTube Amazon Seller Influencers**
   - Sponsor tool review videos (Kevin King, Jungle Scout channel, etc.)
   - Cost: $500-5K per video depending on channel size
   - Impact: Huge — sellers trust video demos

3. **Facebook Groups (Amazon FBA groups)**
   - Share results, answer questions about listing images
   - Need to build reputation first, not spam
   - Partner with group admins for "tool spotlight" features

4. **Hacker News / Indie Hacker Community**
   - Already done (Show HN). Follow up with progress updates.
   - Cross-post to IndieHackers, Twitter #buildinpublic

### Tier 2: Medium Impact, Medium Cost

5. **Amazon Seller Tool Directories**
   - Carbon6 tool list, Jungle Scout ecosystem, Helium 10 integrations
   - Seller tool comparison sites (jordiob.com, etc.)
   - Get listed on tool aggregator sites

6. **SEO / Content Marketing**
   - Target: "Amazon listing images," "A+ Content generator," "Amazon product photography AI"
   - Already have strong use-case page — expand to more keywords
   - Blog posts: "How to create Amazon A+ Content in 30 seconds"

7. **Fiverr/Upwork Displacement**
   - Target sellers who are CURRENTLY hiring designers on Fiverr
   - "Before you spend $300 on a designer, try this for free"
   - Could even partner with designers (they use GreenOnion as their tool)

8. **AppSumo / Product Hunt**
   - Lifetime deal on AppSumo for initial traction boost
   - Product Hunt launch for tech audience
   - Risk: AppSumo customers are deal-seekers, not ideal long-term

### Tier 3: Longer-Term Plays

9. **Shopify App Store**
   - Build Shopify integration, get listed
   - Shopify's app store has built-in distribution
   - Extends beyond Amazon to broader ecommerce

10. **Amazon's Own Ecosystem**
    - Apply for Amazon Seller Central app directory
    - Amazon Partner Network
    - Risk: Amazon could copy the tool

11. **Affiliate Program**
    - Amazon sellers love affiliate income
    - 20-30% recurring commission would drive referrals
    - Many seller influencers monetize via affiliate links

12. **Conference Sponsorship**
    - Prosper Show, Seller Summit booths
    - Expensive ($5K-20K) but high-intent audience
    - Demo stations showing real-time generation = compelling
