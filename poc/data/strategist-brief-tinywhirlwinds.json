  "version": "1.0",
  "analyst": "GrowthMind Strategist",

  "executive_summary": "Tiny Whirlwinds has a validated product that parents love, a genuine structural advantage (Farnham's only dedicated sensory studio), and a founder who nails the delivery — but right now, almost nobody knows it exists. The entire game for the next 90 days is visibility: getting Farnham parents through the door, because the class sells itself once they're in the room. This is a CONDITIONAL GO — the product works, the market's there, but marketing execution is the make-or-break.",

  "current_stage_diagnosis": {
    "stage": "Pre-launch (2 weeks out)",
    "reality_check": [
      "4 term bookings is a start, not traction. You need 8-10 per class to feel viable and 12+ to feel healthy.",
      "Instagram is 2 days old with 90 followers and 1 post. For a B2C baby business, this is effectively zero social presence.",
      "No Google My Business profile, no Happity listing, no local partnerships. You're invisible to parents actively searching.",
      "Only 2 of 4 class types running (Stargazers 0-6mo, Explorers 6-15mo). Active Adventurers unmapped, Parties not ready but still on website.",
      "Solo operator with no backup plan. One illness away from cancelled classes.",
      "Revenue: pre-revenue. Unit economics unknown — breakeven fill rate not calculated.",
      "Website is clean but generic — doesn't communicate the GENTLE positioning or studio advantage."
    ],
    "what_is_working": [
      "The class itself. Trial classes with 6-10 attendees got great feedback. Babies stayed engaged. Jade was confident by session 4.",
      "The studio. A dedicated sensory space with light shows, tactile stations, and proper production values. No local competitor has this.",
      "The positioning. Gentle sensory fills a real gap — parents find Hartbeeps 'too in your face' and Baby Sensory overcrowded.",
      "The pricing. £10/class (term) is competitive with franchises but delivers a premium experience. No franchise fees eating margins.",
      "The founder. Tech background (Dexla), genuinely passionate, IS her own ICP — a Farnham mum who built what she couldn't find."
    ],
    "honest_assessment": "You've done the hardest part — building something genuinely good. Most people never get here. But a great product that nobody knows about is a failed business. The next 30 days will determine whether Tiny Whirlwinds becomes a thriving local institution or a well-kept secret."
  },

  "the_one_thing": {
    "focus": "Get 20 new parents into your studio in the next 30 days.",
    "why": "Everything else flows from this. Bookings create revenue. Revenue creates sustainability. Full classes create word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth creates more bookings. But the flywheel can't spin without those first parents in the room. Your class sells itself — the job is getting people through the door.",
    "how": "Three actions, in order of impact: (1) Visit 5 local venues this week with leaflets — health centre, children's centre, NCT coffee morning, two cafés with parent corners. Introduce yourself in person. (2) Message your 4 existing parents today with a 'bring a friend free' offer for launch week. (3) Post on Instagram 4x this week — launch reel, studio setup, behind-the-scenes, and a 'tips for parents' carousel. That's it. No fancy marketing strategy needed. Just those three things.",
    "what_to_ignore_for_now": "Franchise planning. Brand guidelines. Active Adventurers curriculum. TikTok. A perfect website. Parties offering. Weekend classes. All good ideas — all distractions from the one thing that matters right now."
  },

  "strategic_thesis": {
    "the_bet": "The bet is that an independent, studio-based, gentle-sensory baby class can out-compete national franchises in a local market by being genuinely better where it matters: smaller groups, better environment, more personal, more authentic.",
    "why_it_can_work": [
      "Demand is proven. Baby Sensory is always full in Farnham — there are more parents wanting classes than current supply serves.",
      "The #1 parent complaint (overcrowding) is structurally solved by having a dedicated studio with controlled capacity.",
      "Hartbeeps appears to have exited Farnham — that's a gap in the market with displaced parents.",
      "Parent forums consistently say the individual class leader matters more than the brand. Jade's warmth and delivery quality can beat any franchise script.",
      "Farnham is affluent Surrey — parents here spend on premium baby experiences and the £10/class price point is comfortable.",
      "Post-COVID demand for in-person baby activities exceeds pre-COVID levels. Timing is strong.",
      "Jade's tech background is a dormant superpower — when activated, it creates operational advantages no local competitor can match."
    ],
    "the_risk_in_the_bet": "The bet fails if Jade can't solve the marketing problem. The product is invisible right now. If classes don't fill within 6 weeks of launch, the studio rent burns cash with no revenue to offset it. The bet also fails if solo-operator burnout hits before the business reaches sustainability.",
    "what_makes_this_different_from_yet_another_baby_class": "Three things no franchise in Farnham can replicate: (1) a purpose-built sensory studio with professional production values, (2) an indie founder story that parents connect with emotionally, and (3) a tech-savvy operator who can out-systemise competitors who run on WhatsApp groups and bank transfers."

Walk into the health centre. Post the Reel. Message those parents. The product is ready. The market is ready. You just need to be visible. Everything starts there. Go fill those classes."
