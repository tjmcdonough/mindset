## Critical Priority (Must Answer)

### 1. What is the current state of the product?
**Why unknowable**: The website shows only a title and waitlist. We can't tell if there's a working product, an MVP, or just a landing page.  
**Impact**: Changes everything — a working product with users vs. an idea in development get completely different strategies.

### 2. Do you have any users or waitlist signups? How many?
**Why unknowable**: No public metrics, no social proof, no review sites.  
**Impact**: 0 users = validation-first strategy. 10+ users = growth strategy. 100+ waitlist = launch strategy.

### 3. What's your pricing model and target price point?
**Why unknowable**: No pricing page, no public pricing info.  
**Impact**: Positioning against FileInvite ($829/mo) vs. Content Snare (~$30/mo) is fundamentally different — determines ICP, channels, and messaging.

### 4. Are you building this full-time or alongside freelancing/Gains App?
**Why unknowable**: LinkedIn shows active Gains App role, Upwork freelancing, and DocItEasy simultaneously.  
**Impact**: 10hrs/week side project gets radically different advice than full-time commitment. Solo founder bandwidth is the #1 constraint.

### 5. Who are your first target customers specifically — UK solicitors, Irish solicitors, mortgage brokers, or all of the above?
**Why unknowable**: GitHub says "solicitors and finance professionals" but no specifics on market, country, or firm size.  
**Impact**: UK conveyancing solicitors vs. US mortgage brokers are completely different GTM motions.

## High Priority

### 6. What AI features are actually built vs. planned?
**Why unknowable**: Waitlist page mentions AI classification, smart alerts, predictive automation — but we can't tell what's real.  
**Impact**: If AI classification is working, that's the differentiation moat. If it's roadmap, competitors already do document collection without AI.

### 7. Have you validated the problem with potential customers? What did they say?
**Why unknowable**: No public customer interviews, testimonials, or case studies.  
**Impact**: "I talked to 20 solicitors and they all said X" dramatically changes confidence. Without this, we're guessing at product-market fit.

### 8. What's your differentiation against FileInvite, Clustdoc, and Content Snare?
**Why unknowable**: No positioning page, no comparison content, no competitive claims.  
**Impact**: "We're cheaper" is different from "We use AI to classify documents automatically" — the competitive moat determines everything.

### 9. Do you have legal/finance industry connections in Ireland/UK?
**Why unknowable**: LinkedIn shows tech connections, not legal/finance domain.  
**Impact**: Industry connections = distribution channel. No connections = cold start in a trust-based, relationship-driven market.

### 10. What's your tech architecture — is DocItEasy built on the same LangChain/LangGraph stack from your other projects?
**Why unknowable**: Can infer from GitHub but not confirm.  
**Impact**: If reusing proven AI infrastructure from Gains App/Carelon, that's speed advantage. If building from scratch, longer timeline.

## Medium Priority

### 11. What does success look like for you in 12 months?
**Why unknowable**: Could be a portfolio project, a lifestyle business, or a venture-scale ambition.  
**Impact**: Strategy is completely different for £5K MRR side income vs. £500K ARR funded startup.

### 12. Are you aware of and concerned about the existing competitors in this space?
**Why unknowable**: No public competitive analysis or positioning.  
**Impact**: If FileInvite's $829/mo pricing surprises him, there's a positioning opportunity. If he's already mapped competitors, we can build on that.

### 13. What compliance certifications are you planning (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR)?
**Why unknowable**: No security/compliance page on the website.  
**Impact**: For legal/finance ICP, compliance is table stakes. Without SOC 2 or equivalent, enterprise deals are impossible.

### 14. Have you considered partnering with or integrating into legal practice management software (Clio, Smokeball)?
**Why unknowable**: No integration or partnership info.  
**Impact**: Integration partnerships are the #1 distribution channel for legal tech — could shortcut years of direct sales.

### 15. What's your runway / how long can you sustain development before needing revenue?
**Why unknowable**: Bootstrapped status assumed but financial position unknown.  
**Impact**: 3 months of runway = launch immediately and iterate. 12+ months = can build more before launch.
