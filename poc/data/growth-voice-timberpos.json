  "brand_name_analysis": {
    "name": "Timber",
    "domain": "timberpos.app",
    "assessment": "Problematic. 'Timber' evokes wood/lumber/forestry, not beauty/grooming. 'POS' in the domain further confuses — suggests Point of Sale for a lumber company. Google search results for 'timberpos' return lumber POS systems. The brand actively works against discoverability and positioning.",
    "seo_impact": "Severe — competing for search terms with actual timber/lumber industry POS systems. Someone searching 'timber POS' expects lumber yard software, not barber booking.",
    "recommendation": "Seriously consider rebranding. A name that signals 'booking' or 'barber' or 'appointments' would dramatically improve organic discovery and conversion."

    "homepage_headline": "Online Booking Software for Barbers & Salons - Appointment Scheduling App",

    "assessment": {
      "clarity": "6/10 — says what it does but doesn't differentiate from 50 other tools with identical copy",
      "specificity": "3/10 — 'easiest' is subjective and unsubstantiated. No specific claim or proof point.",
      "differentiation": "2/10 — could be the tagline for literally any booking software. Nothing unique.",
      "emotional_resonance": "3/10 — doesn't speak to a specific pain or aspiration",
      "urgency": "2/10 — no compelling reason to switch from current solution right now"

  "founder_voice_analysis": {
    "reddit_post_tone": "Humble, honest, slightly desperate. Good for building sympathy but not confidence.",

      "friction of booking for customers due to having to download an app or sign up"
    ],
    "strength": "The 'no app download needed' angle is genuinely differentiating — but it's buried in comments, not front and center on the website",
    "weakness": "Selling features ('booking + payments + customer management') instead of outcomes ('stop losing clients to no-shows' or 'fill your empty chairs')"
  },
  "brand_archetype": {
    "current": "The Everyman — trying to be accessible and simple, but ends up being forgettable",
    "recommended": "The Rebel or The Outlaw — position against the bloated, expensive incumbents. 'They charge you $50/month for features you'll never use. We don't.' Or The Caregiver — 'We actually answer when you call.'"

      "Your clients shouldn't need an app just to book a haircut.",
      "Stop losing bookings to download screens. Timber lets clients book in 10 seconds — no app, no signup.",

  "critical_issues": [
    "Website copy couldn't be fully analysed due to SPA rendering — but what's visible (meta tags) is completely generic",

    "No demo video or screenshots discoverable via crawling",
    "Brand name actively hurts SEO and brand recognition",
    "The best messaging angle ('no app download for clients') is hidden in Reddit comments, not on the website"
