    "explanation": "This is not a product problem (yet) — it's a distribution problem. The product exists but nobody in the target market knows about it. The founder is marketing to the wrong people (Reddit SaaS communities) on the wrong platform (Reddit instead of Facebook/Instagram) with the wrong message ('easiest booking software' instead of 'no app download needed'). Every layer of the funnel is broken: discovery, click-through, signup, and conversion."

However, this is a common position for a solo technical founder 1.5 months in. The question isn't 'is this working?' (it's not) — it's 'can the founder shift from building to selling?' If yes, the situation is recoverable. If no, this will slowly die of obscurity.",
