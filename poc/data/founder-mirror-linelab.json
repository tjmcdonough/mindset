      "insight": "You told us you're 'crossing the chasm,' but your customer list — Boeing, Hadrian, GKN Aerospace, Running Tide, MIT, Sidewalk Labs — spans aerospace, climate tech, advanced manufacturing, academia, and Alphabet. That's not a beachhead. That's a trophy case. Moore's entire thesis is that you pick ONE segment and dominate it so thoroughly that pragmatists in adjacent segments hear about you through word-of-mouth. You have 7 logos across 5+ industries. That's the early market — visionaries who bought because the tech is cool. You haven't crossed anything yet.",

        "Solving for Scale Summit mixes industries rather than deepening one vertical"

      "question_for_founder": "If you had to pick ONE industry vertical and say no to every opportunity outside it for the next 18 months, which would it be — and why haven't you done that already?",
      "what_to_do_about_it": "Audit your existing customers: which vertical has (a) the most referenceable wins, (b) the shortest sales cycle, and (c) buyers who talk to each other at the same conferences? Likely aerospace. Commit to it. Build aerospace-specific templates, case studies, pricing, and channel partnerships. Say no to everything else until you have 5+ aerospace customers who will actively refer you.",
      "cognitive_bias": "Collection bias — impressive logos feel like progress, but breadth of logos ≠ depth of market penetration. Each new vertical resets your sales learning to zero."

      "insight": "A December 2025 academic review of 9 simulation tools for smart manufacturing doesn't mention analytical modeling as a category. Your buyers Google 'discrete event simulation software' or 'factory planning tool' — not 'analytical production modeling.' You're creating a category that doesn't exist in the buyer's vocabulary. Category creation is a $50M+ marketing exercise that requires either massive funding or a decade of patience. You have neither. Meanwhile, Autodesk just bought FlexSim and will spend more on marketing it in one quarter than your entire lifetime budget.",

      "what_to_do_about_it": "Stop trying to create 'analytical modeling' as a category. Instead, position as the answer to a search that already exists: 'faster alternative to discrete-event simulation' or 'factory cost optimization software.' Anchor to the buyer's existing mental model, then educate once they're in your funnel. Invest in SEO and content targeting the exact frustration queries showing up on Reddit: 'simulation software too expensive,' 'FlexSim vs AnyLogic,' 'factory planning without simulation.'",
      "cognitive_bias": "Curse of knowledge — you understand the technical distinction between analytical modeling and DES. Your buyers don't. They just want answers faster and cheaper."

      "insight": "Every visible customer has a plausible connection to MIT or the academic research network: Boeing (major MIT research partner), MIT (obviously), Sidewalk Labs (Alphabet, deep MIT ties), Hadrian (YC-backed, VC-connected), GKN Aerospace (UK aerospace with MIT collaboration history), University of Queensland (academic network). Running Tide had MIT-connected advisors. This isn't a repeatable GTM motion — it's a warm-intro network that will exhaust. The question isn't whether these are real customers. They are. The question is: can you close a customer who has never heard of MIT's Advanced Manufacturing program?",

      "what_to_do_about_it": "Map every closed deal to its origin: warm intro, event, inbound, outbound. If >80% are warm intros, you don't have a sales process — you have a network. Build a repeatable inbound engine: SEO content targeting DES frustration keywords, a gated ROI calculator, aerospace-specific case studies, and LinkedIn thought leadership from Scott (not the company page). Goal: close 3 customers in 2026 who found you through content, not connections.",

      "insight": "Visionaries tolerate 'request a demo' because they're buying the vision. Pragmatists won't. Moore's pragmatist buyer needs to build a business case before they ever talk to sales. No pricing page means they can't self-qualify, can't compare you to AnyLogic ($25-150k) or FlexSim ($6k), and can't bring a number to their procurement team. Every 'request a demo' button is a conversion wall that filters for people with time and curiosity — which selects for visionaries, not pragmatists. You're literally building a funnel that prevents you from crossing the chasm.",

      "question_for_founder": "How many website visitors hit your demo page and leave without requesting? And of those who do request, what percentage are pragmatist buyers building a business case vs. visionary early adopters exploring new tech?",
      "what_to_do_about_it": "At minimum, publish a pricing range or 'starting at' figure. Better: offer a self-serve evaluation tier — even if limited — that lets engineers try LineLab on a sample problem without talking to sales. Best: build an ROI calculator on the website that takes their production parameters and shows estimated savings, pre-qualifying them before the demo call. The goal is to let pragmatists self-serve the business case.",
      "cognitive_bias": "Status quo bias — enterprise software 'always' does demo-first sales. But you're a 2-10 person startup competing against Autodesk's distribution. You can't afford the enterprise sales cycle with every prospect."

      "insight": "Your messaging leads with methodology: 'extended queueing theory,' 'mathematical optimization,' 'analytical vs Monte Carlo.' Your growth voice doc literally says 'lead with the outcome, then reveal the method' — but your actual positioning does the opposite. The Winter Simulation Conference paper, the MIT lineage, the 0.64% accuracy figure — these are proof points for engineers evaluating the science. But the VP of Manufacturing who signs the check doesn't care about queueing theory. They care about: 'Will my factory cost what you say it will?' You're an MIT PhD who built something genuinely better. The risk is that you fall in love with WHY it's better rather than focusing on WHAT it does for the buyer.",

        "Product features emphasize methodology (queueing theory, mathematical optimization) over outcomes",
        "Growth voice document itself identifies this tension but the website still leads with technical differentiation",

      "question_for_founder": "If you removed every mention of 'queueing theory,' 'analytical,' and 'MIT' from your website — would the value proposition still be compelling? What would be left?",
      "what_to_do_about_it": "Restructure the website around buyer outcomes, not technology. Homepage hero: '$6M saved. 32% cost avoidance. Answers in minutes.' Save the methodology for a 'How It Works' page that technical evaluators can find. Test this: show your homepage to a VP of Manufacturing who's never heard of queueing theory. If they don't immediately understand what LineLab does for them, the messaging isn't working.",

      "insight": "Your competitive framing positions DES tools as slow, opaque, and stuck in the '90s. But AnyLogic has $26M revenue and 165 employees. FlexSim just got acquired by Autodesk — a company with $5B revenue and every manufacturing engineer's email address. Siemens Tecnomatix is embedded in the PLM stack of every major automotive and aerospace company. These tools aren't going to watch you eat their lunch. AnyLogic is already adding cloud capabilities. Autodesk will bundle FlexSim into Fusion 360 subscriptions. And any of them could bolt on an optimization layer or acquire an analytical engine. Your 18-month head start is a methodological moat, not a business moat.",

      "what_to_do_about_it": "Your moat is methodological depth — extended queueing theory is genuinely hard to replicate. But moats only matter if you have enough market share to defend them. Move faster on GTM. Consider strategic partnerships: could LineLab be the analytical engine inside someone else's platform? Could you partner with a consulting firm (McKinsey, BCG) as their production modeling tool? Being the best technology that nobody uses is not a viable outcome.",

      "insight": "LineLab is a desktop application (Windows/macOS) in an era where every enterprise buyer expects cloud-native, collaborative, and browser-based tools. This isn't just a technical preference — it's a procurement reality. Cloud software goes through IT security review once. Desktop software requires installation approval, endpoint management, update cycles, and per-machine licensing. For a 2-10 person company trying to scale sales, every friction point in procurement is a deal killer. FlexSim went cloud via Autodesk. AnyLogic has a cloud version. Even Siemens moved to Xcelerator cloud. You're the only major player still desktop-only.",

      "what_to_do_about_it": "You don't need to rebuild the product as SaaS overnight. But you need a browser-based entry point — even if it's a limited 'try LineLab' experience that runs a sample model in the cloud. This solves three problems at once: (1) removes procurement friction for evaluation, (2) enables self-serve trial for pragmatist buyers, (3) gives you usage analytics you currently don't have. Consider a phased approach: cloud-hosted demo environment → limited cloud tier → full cloud product."

  "summary": "LineLab has genuinely differentiated technology and impressive early adopter validation. But the company is exhibiting classic signs of a technical founder who has built a better mousetrap and is waiting for the world to beat a path to their door. The core challenge isn't the product — it's the go-to-market. Seven customers across five industries isn't crossing the chasm; it's touring the early market. The MIT network has been a gift for getting started, but it's not a scalable acquisition channel. And the combination of no public pricing, no self-serve trial, desktop-only delivery, and methodology-first messaging creates a funnel that systematically filters out the pragmatist buyers LineLab needs to reach. The technology moat is real but time-limited — Autodesk and Siemens have the resources to close the gap. The clock is ticking on GTM, not on R&D.",
