## 2. Founder Research

### Reddit: u/Ok-Thing8238
- **Post:** "3 months in, just launched my first Shopify app. No idea if it'll work." (r/Entrepreneur, ~Jan 2026)
- **Tone:** Honest, vulnerable, self-aware ("Classic mistake" re: over-building)
- **Self-assessment:** Knows they spent too long building and not enough time launching
- **Current activities:** Google Ads (15 views), preparing Reddit Ads, tweeting
- **Key quote:** "No idea if the pricing angle resonates or if I'm solving a problem nobody cares about"

### Possible Alt Account: u/Jumpy-Possibility754
- Reported connection to "Shopify CRO builder" — insufficient data to confirm

### Professional Profile
- Technical skill: High (built full Shopify app with complex features solo in 3 months)
- Belgium-based (BCDI SNC registration)
- No visible LinkedIn, Twitter, or other professional profiles found
- First-time app founder (based on Reddit post tone)

### Assessment
- **Strengths:** Technical ability, self-awareness, honest communication
- **Concerns:** No visible e-commerce/CRO industry connections, no marketing experience signals, building in relative isolation
- **Pattern:** Classic technical founder — excellent builder, uncertain distributor

## 4. Growth Voice

### Brand Archetype: The Challenger
Revenue Boost positions against the establishment (Privy, Klaviyo) with a pricing fairness argument. "Stop paying per subscriber" is explicitly anti-incumbent.

### Messaging Pillars
1. **Pricing Fairness:** "Pay per message sent, not per contact stored"
2. **Feature Comprehensiveness:** All-in-one (popups + recovery + social proof)
3. **Non-Intrusive Design:** "Indicator-first mode" as UX differentiator
4. **Verified Contacts:** OTP verification eliminates fake signups
5. **Multi-Channel Recovery:** Push → WhatsApp → Email cascade

### Tone
- Website: Professional, benefit-driven, demo-heavy (interactive demos on every section)
- Reddit: Vulnerable, honest, relatable indie builder
- **Gap:** No consistent brand voice established yet

### Recommended Voice
- **Primary:** Practical expert. "We've solved this specific problem. Here's exactly how."
- **Secondary:** Honest challenger. "You shouldn't pay for contacts you never message."
- **Avoid:** Enterprise-speak, buzzwords, aggressive competitor bashing

## 5. Audience Pulse

### Where Shopify Merchants Discuss Tools

#### Reddit (Active, searchable)
- **r/shopify** (~800K members) — Primary; merchants ask "what app for X?" regularly
- **r/ecommerce** (~300K) — Broader e-commerce discussion
- **r/ShopifyeCommerce** — Technical Q&A focus
- **r/Emailmarketing** — Email/SMS tool comparisons
- **r/ShopifyAppDev** — Developer-focused, ASO discussions

#### Recent Discussion Themes (researched)
- "Workflow or tool for recovering carts on Shopify — what actually worked?" (Aug 2025) — merchants struggling with <10% recovery rates
- "Who do you use for abandoned cart emails?" (Mar 2025) — Klaviyo and Omnisend dominate recommendations
- "What's the most useful Shopify app you have ever used?" (Aug 2025) — Wisepops mentioned for popups
- "What's your favorite Shopify app that actually helps sales?" (Oct 2025) — Klaviyo + OptiMonk combo frequently cited
- "Best OptiMonk alternatives?" (May 2025) — Wisepops, ConvertFlow, Privy recommended

#### Key Insight from Audience Research
**Nobody is recommending Revenue Boost anywhere.** Zero organic mentions. Zero word-of-mouth. The founder's single Reddit post is the only public trace. In a market where peer recommendations drive installs, this is the #1 problem.

#### Shopify Community Forums
- Active discussion of popup apps, especially around speed impact
- Merchants concerned about "app bloat" slowing their stores
- Revenue Boost claims "zero slowdown" — potentially strong positioning if proven

#### Facebook Groups
- Various Shopify merchant groups (Shopify Entrepreneurs, Shopify Masters)
- Less technical, more "what worked for me" testimonial-driven
- Good channel for social proof once it exists

## 6. Channel Finder

### Best Distribution Channels for a Shopify App (Ranked)

1. **Shopify App Store SEO** (Critical)
   - #1 discovery channel for Shopify apps
   - Ranking factors: reviews, installs, keywords, rating
   - Revenue Boost has 0 reviews — completely invisible in search results
   - **Blocker:** Can't rank without reviews; can't get reviews without installs

2. **Shopify App Store Ads** (High)
   - Pay-per-click advertising within App Store search results
   - Good for bootstrapping initial visibility when organic ranking is impossible
   - Requires budget allocation

3. **Content Marketing / SEO** (High, Long-term)
   - Blog posts targeting "best Shopify popup app" comparisons
   - "How to reduce cart abandonment on Shopify" type content
   - Revenue Boost website already has good on-page content

4. **Reddit** (Medium)
   - r/shopify, r/ecommerce — participate genuinely in discussions
   - Answer "what popup app should I use?" questions
   - Founder already active here — extend to merchant-focused subs

5. **Shopify Partner/Agency Outreach** (High)
   - Agencies recommend tools to their clients
   - One agency partnership = dozens of installs
   - Requires relationship building and possibly a partner programme

6. **Product Hunt Launch** (Medium)
   - One-time visibility spike
   - Good for backlinks and initial credibility
   - Best timed after getting a few reviews

7. **YouTube / Video Content** (Medium)
   - "Revenue Boost vs Privy" comparison videos
   - Tutorial content showing the app in action
   - Searchable, long-tail traffic

8. **Twitter/X** (Low)
   - Shopify merchants not primarily on Twitter
   - Good for founder brand building but low direct conversion

9. **Google Ads** (Low Priority Now)
   - Currently running with 15 views — extremely low volume
   - Expensive for app install campaigns
   - Better to invest in organic channels first

## 7. Domain Expert — Shopify App Ecosystem Deep Dive

### How Shopify Apps Get Discovered

#### App Store Search (60-70% of installs)
- Merchants search by problem: "popup", "cart recovery", "spin wheel"
- Results ranked by: relevance, reviews, rating, install velocity, engagement
- **February 2024 algorithm change** (per developer reports): increased weight on merchant engagement metrics and reduced pure keyword stuffing

#### App Store Categories
- Revenue Boost is in "Marketing and Conversion" → "Abandoned Cart"
- Category page shows "Best" apps — dominated by those with 300+ reviews
- "More apps like this" sidebar on competitor listings can drive discovery

#### What Drives Installs
1. **Reviews are king.** An app with 0 reviews is essentially invisible. Even 5-10 reviews dramatically improve discovery.
2. **Rating quality.** 4.5+ stars is the threshold for merchant trust.
3. **Screenshot quality.** First impression in search results — Revenue Boost needs compelling screenshots.
4. **"Built for Shopify" badge.** Signals quality to merchants. Requires meeting Shopify's technical standards.
5. **Free plan availability.** Revenue Boost has this — good for reducing friction.

#### The Cold Start Problem
Revenue Boost faces the classic cold start:
- Can't rank in search without reviews
- Can't get reviews without installs
- Can't get installs without ranking or external traffic

**Breaking the cold start requires:**
- Direct outreach to get first 10-20 installs
- Begging/incentivising those users for reviews (within Shopify's TOS)
- External traffic sources (Reddit, content, partnerships) to bypass App Store search
- Potentially App Store ads to jumpstart visibility

#### Role of Reviews
- **Quantitative:** More reviews = higher ranking = more organic installs
- **Qualitative:** Merchants read reviews carefully, especially recent ones
- **Velocity matters:** 5 reviews in a week signals more than 5 reviews over 6 months
- **Competitor benchmark:** The "also recommended" apps on Revenue Boost's page already have 63-440+ reviews

#### Shopify Partner Programme
- Shopify takes 0% revenue share for the first $1M earned (changed 2021)
- This is extremely favourable for new apps — all revenue is retained
- Partner programme provides resources, documentation, and developer support
- "Built for Shopify" designation available for apps meeting quality criteria

### Key Ecosystem Insight
**The Shopify App Store is a reviews-driven marketplace.** Revenue Boost's biggest challenge isn't feature completeness (it's arguably over-featured) — it's getting from 0 to 50 reviews. Every strategy should be evaluated through the lens of: "Does this generate an install that could become a review?"
