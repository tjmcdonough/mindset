      "question": "How full are your classes right now? Like, if a class holds 10 spots, how many are you actually filling on average — and is that mostly term bookings or drop-ins?",
      "why_it_matters": "Fill rate and term-vs-drop-in split reveals actual revenue per class and demand strength. The website says 100+ babies served but we have no idea about current weekly utilisation.",

      "why_it_matters": "Solo operator risk is the biggest structural vulnerability. Her answer reveals whether she's thought about hiring, training someone, or if this is an unaddressed anxiety. Critical for any scaling plan.",
