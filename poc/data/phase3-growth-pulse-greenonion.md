# Phase 3.2: Growth Pulse — GreenOnion

## Current Growth State
- **Stage:** Pre-traction (9 paying customers, ~1 month)
- **MRR:** ~$500-1,000 [INFERRED based on tier distribution unknown]
- **Growth rate:** N/A (too early for trend)
- **Primary acquisition:** HN post + organic [INFERRED]

## Growth Health Indicators

### 🟢 Positive Signals
1. **First customer bought highest tier immediately** — strong willingness to pay, suggests value is obvious
2. **Emotional customer reaction** — deep pain being solved, not a "nice to have"
3. **Self-serve free trial works** — product sells itself without sales calls
4. **Fast time-to-value (30 seconds)** — reduces activation friction dramatically
5. **9 customers in ~1 month with minimal marketing** — organic demand exists

### 🟡 Caution Signals
1. **Solo founder with day job** — growth will be constrained by available hours
2. **No clear acquisition channel** — HN is one-time, what's repeatable?
3. **Pricing too low** — MRR growth limited even with customer growth
4. **No retention data** — too early but critical to track

### 🔴 Risk Signals
1. **No social proof** — website has zero testimonials
2. **No conversion data from customers** — can't prove ROI
3. **Competitor awareness unclear** — may be unaware of Ecomtent, Pic Copilot
4. **No content marketing / SEO** — not building organic acquisition flywheel

## Growth Velocity Assessment
- **Current trajectory:** ~2-3 customers/week [INFERRED from 9 in ~4 weeks]
- **At current pricing:** 100 customers = ~$5K MRR (at $49 avg)
- **With repricing:** 100 customers at $149 avg = ~$15K MRR
- **Time to 100 customers:** 3-6 months with active growth effort [ESTIMATE]

## Critical Growth Unlocks
1. **Raise prices 3-5x** — immediate MRR multiplier
2. **Add testimonials/case studies** — the "wanted to cry" story needs to be on the website NOW
3. **YouTube influencer review** — one video could 10x customer base
4. **Reddit strategy** — authentic participation in r/FulfillmentByAmazon
5. **Conversion tracking** — help customers measure before/after, use data in marketing

## Growth Model Recommendation
**Product-Led Growth (PLG) with Community Seeding**
- Free trial → see your product look amazing → upgrade
- Seed in Amazon seller communities (Reddit, Facebook)
- Influencer amplification for breakout moments
- Content marketing for compounding organic growth
