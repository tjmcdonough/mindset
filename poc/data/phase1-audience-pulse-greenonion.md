## Audience Behavior Patterns
1. **Discovery:** Sellers find tools via YouTube reviews, Facebook group recommendations, Reddit threads, and Google searches
2. **Evaluation:** Free trial → see results on their own products → compare to current solution
3. **Purchase trigger:** Seeing their OWN product look professional, not generic demos
4. **Retention:** Tool must save time consistently, not just for first use
5. **Word of mouth:** Sellers share tools in private groups when they work well

## Key Insight
Amazon sellers are **tool-addicted** — they already pay for Helium 10 ($79-229/mo), Jungle Scout ($49-129/mo), etc. A $49-149/mo image tool fits their existing spending pattern. The audience is PRE-QUALIFIED to pay for tools that save time and increase sales.
