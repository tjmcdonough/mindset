# Phase 4: Projections — DocItEasy

## 1. Strategist Brief

### ⚡ The One Thing
**Ship a real landing page and talk to 10 solicitors this month. You have zero validation and zero visibility — everything else is premature optimization.**

Your product may be brilliant. Your AI skills are genuinely strong. But right now, you're invisible. No potential customer can find you. No one can understand what you're building. And most critically — you haven't validated that solicitors will pay for AI document collection over the tools they already use (or over email, which is free).

One conversation with a solicitor who says "I'd pay £200/month for this" is worth more than a month of coding.

### 30-60-90 Day Priority Stack

#### Days 1-30: Validate & Be Visible
1. **Build a real landing page** (2 days) — problem, solution, features, waitlist CTA
2. **Customer discovery sprint** — 10 calls with UK/Ireland solicitors about document collection pain
3. **LinkedIn presence** — 3 posts/week on AI in legal tech, build-in-public updates
4. **Competitive deep-dive** — sign up for free trials of FileInvite, Clustdoc, Content Snare. Know your enemy.
5. **Write 2 SEO articles** — "Document Collection Software for Law Firms" + "FileInvite Alternative"

**Exit criteria**: 10 customer conversations completed, 50+ waitlist signups, clear problem validation

#### Days 31-60: Build & Partner
1. **Recruit 3-5 design partners** — free access, weekly feedback
2. **Ship AI document classification** — make it demonstrably better than manual
3. **Apply to Clio App Directory** — begin integration process
4. **Launch free AI Document Classifier** — lead gen tool
5. **Get listed on G2 and Capterra** — even without reviews, being listed matters

**Exit criteria**: 3+ active design partners, AI classification working in production, 1 integration in progress

#### Days 61-90: Launch & Learn
1. **Soft launch with pricing** — start charging design partners or new customers
2. **Collect testimonials** — from design partner experience
3. **Content push** — case study, comparison pages, 2 more SEO articles
4. **First 5 paying customers** — organic + outreach
5. **Decision point** — is this getting enough traction to reduce freelancing hours?

**Exit criteria**: 5+ paying customers, £1K+ MRR, clear retention signals

## 2. Growth Advisor

### Cross-Agent Patterns

**Pattern 1: Technical Founder Trap**
Multiple signals converge: strong AI skills + minimal marketing + empty website + no customer conversations. This is the classic "build it and they will come" pattern. The founder's instinct is to make the AI better before showing it to anyone. But in legal tech, the buyer doesn't care about your LangGraph architecture — they care about "will this save me 5 hours a week and keep me compliant?"

**Pattern 2: Scattered Attention**
The founder is simultaneously freelancing, building for Gains App, and building DocItEasy. Every successful SaaS founder we've analyzed who broke through did so with focused effort. The ones who kept "optionality" with consulting/freelancing grew 3-5x slower.

**Pattern 3: Market Validates, Product Doesn't (Yet)**
The market research is clear: document collection is a real pain, buyers pay $70-$2,500/month, and AI is the next differentiator. But the product doesn't exist publicly. This is a timing risk — the window between "AI is a differentiator" and "every competitor has AI" is probably 12-18 months.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Anti-Pattern 1: Over-Engineering Before Validation**
Don't build predictive automation, smart alerts, and AI classification before knowing which ONE feature solicitors will pay for. Ship the simplest version that solves one pain point.

**Anti-Pattern 2: Pricing to Compete**
Don't price at $20/month to undercut Content Snare. Price at $150-300/month to signal professional quality. Legal/finance buyers are suspicious of cheap tools — security and reliability concerns.

**Anti-Pattern 3: Targeting Everyone**
"Solicitors and finance professionals" is two markets, not one. Pick one. Solicitors are easier to reach (Law Society directories, legal tech communities) and have more acute document collection pain (conveyancing requires 20+ document types).

### Contradictions Identified
- The founder positions as "production-grade AI engineer" but the product website is barely functional — suggests product building is happening but GTM is being neglected
- Targets "solicitors and finance professionals" but has no visible legal or finance domain connections
- Has AI expertise that could differentiate but no public demonstration of it
