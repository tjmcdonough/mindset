# Phase 0.5: Agent Gap Analysis — OneCamp

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Product:** OneCamp (self-hosted all-in-one workspace)
**Domain:** Productivity/Collaboration SaaS, Self-Hosted Infrastructure

---

## Specialist Agents Recommended

### 1. Self-Hosted/DevOps Community Agent
**Why:** OneCamp's entire GTM depends on reaching self-hosted enthusiasts. An agent specializing in r/selfhosted, Hacker News, awesome-selfhosted, and Docker Hub ecosystems would map distribution channels precisely.
**Gap without it:** We'll approximate community dynamics from general research.

### 2. Open Source Licensing & Business Model Agent
**Why:** The self-hosted market has strong opinions about licensing (see: Mattermost/Rocket.Chat backlash over moving features behind paywalls). OneCamp needs expert guidance on open-core vs. proprietary vs. source-available models.
**Gap without it:** We'll use general knowledge of OSS business models.

### 3. Developer Relations / Technical Marketing Agent
**Why:** OneCamp's audience is deeply technical (Docker users). Marketing playbooks for consumer SaaS don't apply. Need specialist in DevRel-style content (blog posts about architecture, Docker Compose tutorials, comparison guides).
**Gap without it:** We'll adapt general content strategy to technical audience.

### 4. Video/RTC Infrastructure Agent
**Why:** Video/audio calling with recording and transcription is a massive technical challenge. Understanding WebRTC infrastructure, scaling challenges, and competitive landscape (Jitsi, LiveKit) would inform positioning.
**Gap without it:** We'll note this as a technical risk area without deep analysis.

### 5. Privacy/Compliance Specialist Agent
**Why:** Self-hosted buyers often care about GDPR, data sovereignty, HIPAA. Understanding which compliance certifications matter and how to message around them is critical for enterprise sales.
**Gap without it:** We'll flag compliance as an opportunity without detailed regulatory mapping.

## Proceeding Without Specialist Agents
All gaps are flagged as [INFERRED] throughout the cascade. The core analysis remains actionable but would benefit from the above specialists for execution-level detail.
