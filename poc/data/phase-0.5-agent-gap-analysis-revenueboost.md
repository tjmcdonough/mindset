## Specialist Agents Needed for Shopify App / E-Commerce CRO Analysis

### 1. Shopify App Store Analyst
**Why needed:** The Shopify App Store is its own ecosystem with unique ranking dynamics. Discovery is driven by reviews, install velocity, keyword matching, and Shopify's "Built for Shopify" badge programme. Revenue Boost launched Dec 5, 2025 — currently 0 reviews, 0 ratings. Understanding how to break through from zero is critical.

**What it would do:**
- Analyse App Store ranking factors (reviews, installs, keyword density)
- Benchmark against competitors' listing quality (Privy: 4,191 reviews; OptiMonk: 440+; Wisepops: 304)
- Identify keyword gaps in the listing
- Assess "Built for Shopify" badge eligibility

### 2. CRO Metrics Validator
**Why needed:** Revenue Boost claims specific conversion metrics (60% lower bounce rate, 9% spin wheel conversion, 25% recovery rate). These need validation against industry benchmarks.

**What it would do:**
- Cross-reference claims against published benchmarks (OptiMonk says gamified popups average 13.23%; Wisepops says spin wheels average 10.15%)
- Flag claims that are aspirational vs. demonstrated
- Assess whether "indicator-first mode" bounce rate reduction is plausible

### 3. Competitive Intelligence Agent
**Why needed:** The popup + cart recovery space is dominated by well-funded incumbents (Klaviyo: IPO'd, $7.7B market cap; Privy: 4,800+ reviews). Revenue Boost needs precise competitive positioning.

**What it would do:**
- Map feature parity across all 7+ competitors
- Identify genuine feature gaps Revenue Boost fills
- Analyse pricing model differences (per-contact vs per-message)
- Monitor competitor App Store reviews for pain points

### 4. Shopify Merchant Sentiment Analyst
**Why needed:** Shopify merchants discuss tools in specific communities (r/shopify, r/ecommerce, Shopify Community forums, Facebook groups). Understanding current sentiment about popup apps and cart recovery tools reveals demand signals.

**What it would do:**
- Mine Reddit/forum discussions for popup app frustrations
- Identify common complaints about existing tools (pricing, complexity, speed)
- Track "what app do you recommend for X" threads
- Gauge merchant willingness to try new/unknown apps

### 5. Pricing Model Analyst
**Why needed:** Revenue Boost's "pay per message sent, not per contact stored" model is potentially differentiated. Need to analyse whether this is genuinely better economics for merchants or just different.

**What it would do:**
- Model total cost of ownership: Privy vs Revenue Boost at various store sizes
- Determine at what merchant size the per-message model becomes more/less expensive
- Assess whether merchants care about pricing model or just total cost
- Benchmark against Recart, PushOwl pricing structures

### 6. App Review Mining Agent
**Why needed:** Competitor reviews contain goldmine data about unmet needs, pain points, and switching triggers.

**What it would do:**
- Analyse 1-2 star reviews of Privy, OptiMonk, Justuno
- Identify recurring complaints (speed, price increases, support quality)
- Find feature requests that Revenue Boost already addresses
- Build "switching pitch" ammunition

### 7. Shopify Partner Ecosystem Agent
**Why needed:** The Shopify partner ecosystem (agencies, freelancers, theme developers) is a major app distribution channel that most new app developers overlook.

**What it would do:**
- Map the Shopify partner/agency landscape
- Identify agencies that recommend popup/CRO tools to their clients
- Assess partner programme viability for Revenue Boost
- Research Shopify's "Staff Picks" and editorial promotion criteria

## Agents Available in Current GrowthMind System
All standard cascade agents are available. The above specialist gaps are addressed through manual research integration in subsequent phases.

## Key Gap: No Live Data
Revenue Boost has zero users, zero reviews, and zero public traction data. All analysis must rely on:
- Website content and Shopify App Store listing
- Founder's single Reddit post
- Competitor benchmarking
- Industry data extrapolation

This limits confidence to ~32% until founder interrogation provides actual product/usage data.
