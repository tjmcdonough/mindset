2. **No pricing** — unknown business model specifics
3. **No customer count** — appears pre-revenue
4. **No team beyond founder** — solo operation assumed
5. **No funding info** — assumed bootstrapped
6. **No waitlist size** — can't assess demand
7. **No competitive differentiation details** — how is this different from FileInvite, Clustdoc, Content Snare?
8. **No ICP specifics** — "solicitors and finance" is broad

### Agent Confidence Impact
| Agent | Confidence | Reason |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Company Seed | 35% | Minimal public info, pre-launch, no product visible |
| Founder Research | 65% | LinkedIn + GitHub provide solid background |
| Market Intel | 70% | Market is well-documented regardless of company info |
| Growth Voice | 20% | No content, no messaging, no brand voice samples |
| Audience Pulse | 50% | Can infer from ICP but no validation |
| Channel Finder | 55% | Can recommend based on ICP/market |
| Strategic Assessment | 30% | Too many unknowns for high-confidence verdict |
| Growth Experiments | 50% | Can propose but can't calibrate |

### Overall Pre-Interrogation Confidence: **35%**

This is a very early-stage product with minimal public footprint. The founder has strong technical credentials but the product itself is essentially invisible to public research. Most insights will be market-based inference rather than company-specific analysis.
