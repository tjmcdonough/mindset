# Phase 4.1: Strategist Brief — GreenOnion

## ONE-PAGE BRIEF

### What GreenOnion Is
AI tool that generates 9 professional Amazon listing images from one product photo in 30 seconds. Zero prompts required. Built by Nikos Fertakis (Head of Product at Skroutz, Greece's largest marketplace). Solo founder, 1 month old, 9 paying customers.

### The Opportunity
- **Market:** 1.9M+ active Amazon sellers, ~500K need image help, spending $200-500/mo on tools already
- **Current alternatives:** Freelancers ($300-500/listing), Ecomtent ($510/mo), Photoroom ($10-30/mo but not Amazon-specific), or DIY (3-5 hours/product)
- **GreenOnion's edge:** Zero-prompt, full 9-image set, 30 seconds, $1.19/listing at current pricing

### The Three Big Insights

**1. Pricing is the #1 immediate lever.**
GreenOnion charges $149/mo for 125 generations. Ecomtent charges $510/mo for 25 SKUs. That's a ~20x price-per-unit gap. Raising to $399/mo would still be 75% cheaper than the closest competitor and triple MRR overnight. Amazon sellers routinely pay $79-229/mo for Helium 10 — price sensitivity is lower than the founder thinks.

**2. "Just prompts" is NOT a moat problem — it's a framing problem.**
The founder describes his tech as "just prompts" but it's actually: multi-model orchestration + domain-specific constraints + 8-step workflow pipeline + Amazon compliance automation. Jasper.ai built a $1.5B company on "just prompts." The moat is the CURATION — achieving 95%+ usable outputs is genuinely hard engineering. The real threat isn't technical replication; it's distribution (Canva/Adobe).

**3. The "wanted to cry" reaction IS product-market fit.**
When a customer has an emotional relief response to your product, you've found a deep pain point. This isn't a "nice tool" — it's solving a genuine bottleneck that causes real frustration. 9 customers in a month with minimal marketing and a HN post confirms organic pull. This is a scaling problem, not a traction problem.

### What GreenOnion Should Do Next (Priority Order)
1. **Raise prices 3-5x** (this week)
2. **Add testimonials to website** (this week)
3. **Post before/after showcases on Reddit** (this month)
4. **Get 1 YouTube influencer review** (this quarter)
5. **Build category-specific landing pages for SEO** (this quarter)
6. **Decide: side project or full-time business** (this quarter)

### Key Risks
- Pic Copilot (Alibaba) is free and data-rich
- Amazon could build this natively
- Canva/Adobe could add it in 12-18 months
- Solo founder + day job = growth ceiling

### The Bottom Line
GreenOnion has a strong product, obvious PMF signals, and is in a massive market. The founder is underpricing by 3-5x and underselling his own technical moat. The window to establish market position before generalist platforms catch up is 12-24 months. The #1 risk isn't competition — it's the founder not moving fast enough because he's treating a real business like a side project.
