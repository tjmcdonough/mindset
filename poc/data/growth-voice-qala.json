  "brand_archetype": {
    "primary": "The Sentinel",
    "description": "The ever-watchful guardian that sees what others miss. Not the loud alarm — the quiet, always-on awareness that lets teams move fast because someone trustworthy is watching the data. Combines the Engineer's precision with the Guardian's protective instinct, but leads with visibility rather than fear.",
    "secondary": "The Translator",
    "secondary_rationale": "Qala bridges the gap between engineering velocity and compliance requirements — translating regulatory complexity into developer-friendly, automated workflows. This archetype supports the 'shift-left' positioning."
  },

  "current_voice_assessment": {
    "overall_tone": "Technical-confident with compliance urgency",
    "technical_vs_accessible": 0.65,
    "technical_vs_accessible_note": "Leans technical (data observability, lineage, NLP classification, shift-left) but keeps language accessible enough for non-engineers. No deep jargon like API specs or code samples.",
    "enterprise_vs_startup": 0.55,
    "enterprise_vs_startup_note": "Slightly enterprise-leaning. Heavy use of compliance frameworks (GDPR, DORA, SOC2, ISO 27001) and phrases like 'audit-ready' signal enterprise buyers. But '30 minutes to integrate' and 'zero drama' inject startup energy.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear problem framing: 'your product shouldn't be a black box'",
      "Strong shift-left narrative that resonates with modern engineering culture",
      "Good balance of compliance urgency without fear-mongering",
      "'Continuous, not a checkbox' is a sharp differentiator line"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Excessive repetition — the same phrases ('real-time data visibility', 'at-rest and in-transit data monitoring') repeat 15+ times on the homepage, likely a Framer template issue that dilutes impact",
      "SEO keyword stuffing is visible and undermines credibility with technical audiences",
      "No customer proof, no logos, no quotes — creates a trust vacuum at a stage where social proof matters most",
      "Voice is impersonal — no founder personality, no origin story on the homepage, no 'why we built this'",
      "Too many features listed without hierarchy — everything feels equally important",
      "Missing emotional hook — compliance pain is real but the copy stays rational/functional"
    ]

  "recommended_voice": {
    "stage_context": "Pre-seed, demo-only, 3 founders with a successful exit (Imburse → Duck Creek). Targeting data engineers, CISOs, DPOs at regulated scale-ups.",
    "voice_label": "Calm Authority",
    "description": "Speak like the senior engineer who's already solved this problem at their last company. Confident but not boastful. Technical but not gatekeeping. The voice of people who built and exited a payments platform in regulated finance — they know what compliance pain feels like from the inside.",
    "principles": [
      {
        "principle": "Show, don't claim",
        "guidance": "At pre-seed with no public customers, every unsubstantiated claim ('industry-leading', 'best-in-class') erodes trust. Use demo screenshots, architecture diagrams, and specific technical details instead."
      },
      {
        "principle": "Founder credibility is your proof point",
        "guidance": "Three co-founders who built and sold Imburse to Duck Creek is your strongest trust signal. Lead with this — it answers 'why should I trust a pre-seed company with my compliance?'"
      },
      {
        "principle": "Be specific, not comprehensive",
        "guidance": "Don't try to sound like a Series C platform. Pick 2-3 things Qala does exceptionally and go deep. 'We classify sensitive data at the API layer in real-time' beats a wall of features."
      },
      {
        "principle": "Respect the buyer's intelligence",
        "guidance": "CISOs and data engineers detect marketing fluff instantly. Use precise language. Say 'DORA Article 15 operational resilience testing' not just 'DORA compliance'."

      "confident_humble": "65/35 — earned confidence from the Imburse exit, humble about being early-stage.",

    {
      "pattern": "Vague enterprise language",
      "example": "'Digital transformation', 'leverage synergies', 'holistic solution', 'end-to-end platform'",
      "why": "This is the language of incumbents. Qala should sound like the insurgent. Specificity is your weapon."

    {
      "pattern": "Fear-based compliance messaging",
      "example": "'Avoid massive GDPR fines!' or 'Don't get caught non-compliant!'",

      "example": "Repeating 'real-time data visibility' and 'at-rest and in-transit data monitoring' in every paragraph",

      "example": "'Unlike Collibra, we...' or 'Better than BigID because...'",
