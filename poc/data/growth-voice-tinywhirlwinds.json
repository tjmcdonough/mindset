    "rationale": "Tiny Whirlwinds leads with warmth, safety, and developmental care (Nurturer) but wraps it in wonder, discovery, and adventure language (Explorer). The class names — Stargazers, Explorers, Adventurers — signal curiosity, while the core promise is about safe, supported development. This dual archetype is potent for the ICP: parents want reassurance AND excitement for their child."

      "Generic in places — 'safe, welcoming, and incredibly fun' could describe any baby class",
      "EYFS/Birth to 5 Matters reference in the tagline is jargon most parents won't recognise or care about",
      "No founder voice or personal story on the homepage — misses the relatability angle",
      "Lacks specificity — no mention of Farnham, the dedicated studio, or what makes sessions tangibly different",
      "Testimonials are anonymous, reducing trust",
      "Missing emotional urgency — no acknowledgment of the parent's feelings (isolation, overwhelm, guilt)"

    "Launch Instagram immediately — this is the #1 discovery channel for the ICP. Aim for 3-4 posts/week mixing Reels, Stories, and carousels.",
    "Add named testimonials with photos — anonymous quotes carry 50% less weight.",
    "Create a 'What to Expect' page — new parents are anxious about first classes. Walk them through arrival to departure.",
