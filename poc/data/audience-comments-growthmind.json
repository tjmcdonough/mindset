      "comment": "contract scanning is actually a great niche because you can find your ICP so easily — go to r/freelance, r/contractors, r/legaladvice and just... answer questions about contracts. don't pitch. just help people and have your tool in your profile.\n\nalso tbh the fastest path to 10 beta testers: find 50 freelancers on twitter/linkedin who've posted about getting screwed by a contract. DM them offering free access. most won't reply but you only need 10.\n\nthe \"build it and they will come\" thing is a lie. at this stage it's manual, ugly, one-at-a-time outreach. that's normal.\n\nfwiw i'm building something called growthmind.ai that helps early founders figure out exactly which growth experiments to run each week — basically because i kept getting stuck at this same stage myself.",

      "comment": "your infra sounds legit but the pattern you're describing — ship fast, no traction, ship again — is the classic builder's trap. distribution isn't a thing you bolt on after. it needs to be the constraint you design around.\n\npractical suggestion: pick the ONE product where you got that R&D client through contacts-of-contacts. that warm path is your distribution channel. double down on it. go find 5 more companies in that exact vertical and do direct outreach.\n\nthe \"I can build in <1 week\" superpower becomes dangerous when it lets you avoid the hard thing (selling to one specific person).\n\ni've been obsessing over this exact problem and started building growthmind.ai to help pre-PMF founders diagnose where they actually are and run the right experiments. still early but the framework might be useful.",

      "comment": "you already diagnosed yourself perfectly — \"I optimized for ships completed when I should have optimized for problems validated.\" that's the whole answer tbh.\n\nmy vote is Option A with a twist: pick the 2-3 where you got the most *unprompted* inbound interest (not github stars — actual people asking for it). then give yourself 90 days per product with one rule: no building. only talking to users and selling what already exists.\n\nre: B2B vs consumer — you have a consulting biz with B2B relationships. that's an unfair advantage most indie hackers would kill for. use it.\n\nthe calendar app with community interest sounds promising if you can convert free users to paid.\n\ni'm working on something at growthmind.ai that basically automates this triage — figuring out which stage you're at and what to focus on next. might be relevant for you.",

      "comment": "\"putting lipstick on a pig rather than helping decide if we should be raising a pig\" — this is painfully accurate and honestly a sign you understand product better than you think.\n\nwhen i was in a similar spot i reframed it: instead of fighting for a title change, i just started doing product work. wrote a one-pager on who the customer actually is. shared it casually. when it clicked with the founders, suddenly i was \"the product person\" without asking.\n\nre: mental health — if the pivots are weekly with no thesis behind them, that's not iteration, it's chaos. worth having an honest convo about whether there's a real strategy or just vibes.\n\nno silver bullet but you clearly think about this the right way.",

      "comment": "this is the question nobody answers honestly. \"just talk to users\" assumes you have users. here's how i've actually gotten early ones:\n\n- cold outreach on linkedin. not \"check out my product\" but \"i noticed you deal with [problem], can i get 15 min of your time? building something and want to make sure it doesn't suck\"\n- post in niche communities where your ICP hangs out. not pitching, just participating\n- find adjacent products on Product Hunt, look at who reviewed them, reach out\n\nthe trick is framing it as asking for help, not selling. people love giving advice.\n\nalso: you don't need \"users\" to iterate. you need 5 conversations with people who have the problem. that's it.\n\ni've been building growthmind.ai around this exact gap — helping pre-PMF founders figure out what to do when all the advice assumes you're further along than you are.",
