# Phase 1.4: Growth Voice Analysis — GreenOnion

## Website Copy Analysis

### Tone & Style
- **Professional but accessible** — clean, benefit-focused copy
- **Data-heavy** — lots of specific numbers (30 seconds, 95%+, 33-94% conversion increase, 3,058% ROI)
- **Problem-first framing** — leads with pain points, follows with solution
- **Comparison tables** — explicit cost comparisons vs photographers/designers
- **Low ego** — product speaks for itself, no "revolutionary" or "disrupting" language

### Messaging Strengths
- Strong value proposition framing: "$4.90 per 9-image set" vs "$500-2,000 per shoot"
- Specific workflow (8-step process) builds credibility
- "Zero Prompts" is a powerful differentiator — addresses a real frustration with AI tools
- FAQ section handles objections well (messy photos, Amazon compliance)

### Messaging Weaknesses
- No social proof on website (no testimonials, logos, case studies)
- "GreenOnion" brand name doesn't suggest ecommerce/images [OBSERVATION]
- Missing emotional connection — the "wanted to cry" story is their best marketing but it's only on HN
- ROI calculator feels generic — not personalized

## HN Post Voice Analysis

### Tone
- **Humble and authentic** — "I found the fine line" not "I built the best"
- **Self-deprecating honesty** — "The tech is 'just prompts'" — openly sharing vulnerability
- **Community-minded** — asks for feedback, positions as fellow builder
- **Technically credible** — explains approach without over-engineering the explanation

### What works in the HN post
- Admitting uncertainty (pricing, defensibility, focus) — builds trust
- Specific numbers (9 customers, $149, $3K problem)
- The "wanted to cry" customer quote — genuine PMF signal
- "All one-shot, no editing" — powerful proof

### Voice DNA Summary
- **Archetype:** The Thoughtful Builder (not the Hustler, not the Visionary)
- **Register:** Technical-professional, understated
- **Values:** Reliability, honesty, practicality
- **Risk:** Too modest — may undersell. The HN post is more compelling than the website because it has personality.

## Recommendations for Voice Evolution
1. **Put the "wanted to cry" story front and center** on the website
2. **Lean into the founder's Skroutz background** — "Built by someone who runs a marketplace"
3. **Less corporate website copy, more HN-post authenticity**
4. **Add specificity about the "95%+ usable" claim** — show before/after, show rejected outputs
