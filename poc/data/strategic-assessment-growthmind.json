Reddit signals show founders posting weekly about the build-to-distribute gap, wasted agency spend, and zero-traction despair. 15 signals found in a single scan, 10 scoring 70+. The pain is hair-on-fire for the people experiencing it. Docked points because: it's a 'vitamin vs painkiller' question — founders in acute pain seek help, but many quietly churn out of startups instead of buying tools. The urgency is episodic, not constant."

But SAM is narrow: English-speaking, tech-savvy founders who (a) recognise they have a growth problem, (b) believe an AI tool can help, (c) will pay $20-200/mo for it. At $20/mo average, you need 5,000 paying users for $100k ARR. Achievable but not trivial for a solo founder on evenings/weekends. The market exists but it's fragmented across communities, hard to aggregate, and has high churn (founders quit startups)."

ChatGPT/Claude can approximate 80% of the output with a good prompt chain. The differentiation is in methodology and UX, not in technology. Any well-funded AI startup could build this in a sprint. Defensibility depends on building a data flywheel (experiment outcomes) and community — neither exists yet."

The $20-200/mo range is reasonable compared to alternatives ($3-15k agencies), but pre-PMF founders are notoriously price-sensitive and often pre-revenue themselves. The free tier may cannibalise paid — founders could get the diagnosis and leave. This is the biggest unknown in the entire assessment."

The build-to-distribute gap is widening as AI makes shipping easier — more founders than ever have products but no growth skills. Counter-signal: market may be oversaturated with AI tools generally. Founders have 'AI fatigue' and another AI-powered-X may get eye-rolls. Timing is good but not uniquely good — this window has been open for 12+ months."

    "The concierge MVP form is the right move — but only if you actually do something with the submissions. If 5 founders fill it out and you just send them an AI-generated report without a follow-up conversation, you've learned nothing.",
    "Reddit is your strongest channel, but commenting on threads is not a growth strategy. It's a lead generation tactic. You need a system: comment → DM → conversation → free assessment → feedback → iterate. Track every step.",
    "The biggest risk isn't competition, pricing, or features. It's that you'll spend another 3 months building improvements instead of getting 10 humans to use what you already have. The product is good enough. You are the bottleneck.",
    "Your brand voice and messaging are genuinely excellent — better than most funded startups. But great messaging with zero users is a screenplay, not a business. Ship the words to real eyeballs.",
    "If, after 30 days of genuine outreach, you can't get 5 founders to complete a FREE growth assessment, the problem isn't distribution — it's that the product doesn't deliver enough value to justify even 10 minutes of a founder's time. That's a signal you must not ignore."
