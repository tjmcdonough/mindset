    "dimensions": [
      {
        "dimension": "Problem Urgency",
        "score": 72,
        "rationale": "New parents feel isolated and actively seek structured activities during maternity leave. It's not life-or-death, but the emotional need is real and time-sensitive — babies age out of classes quickly. Parents search proactively ('baby classes near me'). The need renews every cohort of new births."
      },
      {
        "dimension": "Market Size",
        "score": 55,
        "rationale": "Farnham is a small affluent town in Surrey. The local addressable market is limited to parents within a ~15-minute drive radius. UK births are ~650k/year but Farnham's catchment is maybe 500-800 babies at any time. Enough to sustain a solo operator comfortably, but a natural ceiling exists without geographic expansion. Franchise ambitions would unlock this."
      },
      {
        "dimension": "Competitive Differentiation",
        "score": 75,
        "rationale": "Dedicated sensory studio is a genuine structural advantage — no local competitor has one. Small class sizes address the #1 parent complaint (overcrowding). GENTLE positioning carves a distinct lane vs Hartbeeps' theatrics and Baby Sensory's clinical feel. Independent founder story beats franchise anonymity. However, the differentiation only works if communicated — currently invisible due to zero marketing."
      },
      {
        "dimension": "ICP Clarity",
        "score": 80,
        "rationale": "Crystal clear ICP: new mums on maternity leave in Farnham/Surrey with babies 0-15 months, seeking developmental activities and community. Jade IS her own ICP — she built what she couldn't find. Age-banded classes (Stargazers 0-6mo, Explorers 6-15mo) show good segmentation. Easy to find and reach through local channels."
      },
      {
        "dimension": "Willingness to Pay",
        "score": 70,
        "rationale": "Farnham is affluent Surrey — parents here spend on baby activities. £10/class term pricing is competitive with franchises (£6-12/class). £15 drop-in is at the premium end but justified by studio quality. 4 term bookings pre-launch suggests willingness exists. However, free alternatives (library groups, church groups at £1-3) are genuine competition for some segments."
      },
      {
        "dimension": "Timing",
        "score": 75,
        "rationale": "Strong timing. Post-COVID parenting class demand exceeds pre-COVID levels. Sensory classes are the fastest-growing sub-category. Hartbeeps may have exited Farnham (gap in market). Instagram-driven discovery is at peak for this category. Launching before the spring/summer term cycle gives time to build before the critical September intake. Only headwind: falling UK birth rate long-term."

        "item": "Founder-market fit",

        "item": "GENTLE positioning fills a gap",
        "detail": "Parents report Hartbeeps is 'too in your face'. Baby Sensory classes are overcrowded. A calm, intimate, well-produced sensory experience is genuine white space in Farnham."

      {
        "item": "Tech background (Dexla)",
        "detail": "Jade has co-founded a tech company. This means she can build her own booking systems, automate marketing, use data — advantages most baby class operators don't have. Currently underleveraged."
      },
      {
        "item": "Validated product",
        "detail": "Trial classes with 6-10 attendees went well. Babies stayed engaged. Parents gave great feedback. The class itself works — this is the hardest part for a service business."

      {
        "item": "Solo operator with no backup",
        "detail": "Jade will run classes even when sick. This is admirable but unsustainable. One serious illness = cancelled classes = refunds + reputation damage. No assistant, no substitute teacher."

        "item": "Marketing skill gap",

        "item": "Pre-revenue with unknown unit economics",

        "item": "Instagram-ready product",

      {
        "item": "Franchise model long-term",
        "detail": "If Jade proves the model in Farnham, the dedicated-studio franchise concept is genuinely differentiated from hall-based franchises. Entry fees of £10-15k with lower ongoing costs than Baby Sensory could be compelling."

  "verdict": {
    "decision": "CONDITIONAL GO",
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "summary": "Tiny Whirlwinds has strong product-market fit fundamentals: a validated class experience, genuine competitive differentiation (dedicated studio, gentle positioning), a clear ICP, and favourable timing. The product works — trial classes went well and the founder is confident in delivery. The business WILL work if people know about it. The conditional element is entirely about marketing execution and operational resilience. Jade needs to solve two problems in the next 90 days: (1) make Tiny Whirlwinds visible to Farnham parents, and (2) establish a backup plan for when she can't teach.",

      },
      {
        "condition": "Establish at least 3 local referral partnerships",
        "rationale": "Health visitors, NCT, children's centres, local cafes — these are the channels that fill local baby classes. Instagram alone won't do it. Need warm, trusted referrals.",
        "deadline": "End of first term (approx. April 2026)"
      },
      {
        "condition": "Identify and train a backup class leader",
        "rationale": "Solo operator risk is the single biggest threat to business continuity. Even a part-time assistant who can cover illness/holidays removes the existential risk.",

      },
      {
        "condition": "Achieve 60%+ term-on-term rebooking rate",
        "rationale": "Retention proves the product creates genuine value. If parents don't rebook, the class isn't delivering. A healthy baby class should see 60-75% rebooking (accounting for natural age-out).",

      "flag": "Solo operator with no contingency",
      "detail": "Jade's stated position — 'I'll run classes even when sick, only cancel if hospitalised' — is a liability, not a strength. One bad flu = miserable experience for parents and babies. One injury = cancelled term = refunds and reputation damage. This needs solving urgently.",
      "mitigation": "Recruit and train a backup teacher within 3 months. Even a friend/family member who can run a simplified session is better than nothing. Budget £50-100/session for cover."

      "mitigation": "Commit to a simple, repeatable marketing routine (see experiments). Consider a part-time social media helper (local uni student, £10-12/hr, 3-5 hrs/week). Use Canva templates to reduce content creation friction."

      "flag": "Franchise ambition may distract from launch execution",
      "detail": "Jade's vision is a multi-town franchise. This is exciting but dangerous at pre-launch — franchise thinking (brand guidelines, scalable systems, territory planning) can distract from the immediate job: filling classes in Farnham.",
      "mitigation": "Park franchise planning until Farnham is proven (3+ terms, consistently full classes, profitable). Document what works for future replication, but focus all energy on the local launch."
    },
    {
      "severity": "yellow",
      "flag": "No weekend or evening classes",
      "detail": "Mon/Thu/Fri only excludes working parents, dads who work weekdays, and families where both parents want to attend. This limits the addressable market.",

    }
  ],

  "local_business_context": {
    "note": "This assessment is calibrated for a pre-launch local service business, not a tech startup. The relevant benchmarks are: (1) Can she fill classes consistently? (2) Do parents rebook? (3) Does word-of-mouth grow? (4) Is it profitable at a sustainable workload? The franchise ambition is a long-term upside but irrelevant if the first venue doesn't work. Everything flows from proving it in Farnham first."
