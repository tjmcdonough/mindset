  "summary": "Scan of 9 channels across Reddit, Hacker News, and Indie Hackers found 15 signals with 10 scoring 70+ (high-value). The dominant pain theme is the build-to-distribute gap: founders can ship products faster than ever with AI tools, but have zero idea how to get first users. r/SaaS is the highest-signal-density channel for Growthmind's ICP, with multiple posts per week from founders who match perfectly (solo/small team, shipped product, zero traction, seeking growth help). The top 3 signals (scores 90-92) are founders who literally need exactly what Growthmind offers: a system that diagnoses their growth stage and prescribes weekly experiments. Agency frustration is a strong secondary theme that validates Growthmind's positioning as an AI alternative to expensive, ineffective agencies. Recommended immediate actions: (1) engage in r/SaaS 'how to get first users' and 'no idea how to market' threads with value-first content, (2) create a thought leadership post addressing the '22 products, $0 revenue' pattern, (3) set up ongoing monitoring of r/SaaS, r/startups, and r/ycombinator for real-time signal capture."
