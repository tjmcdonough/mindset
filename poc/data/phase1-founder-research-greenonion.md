### Key Insights for Outreach
1. **Skroutz connection is gold** — He understands marketplace dynamics from the platform side. This gives him unique insight into seller needs that most tool founders lack.
2. **ML background at UCL** — The "just prompts" concern may undersell his actual technical sophistication. He knows ML, he chose prompts deliberately.
3. **Greece-based** — May face challenges with US Amazon seller community access, timezone differences, potential credibility gap with US sellers [INFERRED]
4. **Papers We Love** — Intellectually curious, academic-leaning. Likely responds well to data-driven arguments.
5. **Solo founder doing this alongside a senior product role** — Time constraint is real. This is likely a side project being tested for PMF before going full-time [INFERRED]

### Outreach Angles
- Fellow technical founder who chose ecommerce
- Skroutz → deep marketplace understanding → natural founder-market fit
- ML background gives more technical depth than "just prompts" suggests
- Papers We Love → values research and rigor
