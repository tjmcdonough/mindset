  "competitive_dynamics": {
    "summary": "This is one of the most crowded SaaS verticals. Fresha offers a free product that's hard to undercut. SQUIRE has $160M+ in funding targeting barbers specifically. Square has infinite distribution. The window for 'another booking tool' is essentially closed unless there's a genuinely novel angle.",
    "barriers_to_entry": "Very low — building a basic booking tool is a common dev project. The barrier is distribution and trust, not technology.",
    "moat_potential": "Near zero for a generic booking tool. Possible moats: deep niche specialization (e.g., only barbers in one city), superior integrations, community-led growth, or truly novel UX.",
    "key_insight": "The market doesn't need another booking tool. It needs someone who understands a specific segment deeply and builds for their exact workflow. Timber's current positioning is too generic to compete."

    "attractiveness": "low-for-new-entrant",
    "reasoning": "Massive TAM but extremely crowded with well-funded incumbents. Free alternatives exist (Fresha). Low switching costs mean even if you acquire users, retention is hard. Solo founder with no funding competing against companies with $100M+ is a severe structural disadvantage.",
    "possible_path": "Hyper-niche (one specific sub-segment), superior customer service as a moat, local/geographic focus, or pivot to adjacent underserved vertical"
