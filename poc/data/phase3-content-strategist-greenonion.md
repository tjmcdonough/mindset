# Phase 3.5: Content Strategist — GreenOnion

## Content Strategy Overview
GreenOnion's content should serve two audiences simultaneously: **Amazon sellers** (customers) and **the indie/builder community** (brand building + talent attraction).

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: "Before → After" Showcases
- Show real products transformed: messy phone photo → 9 professional images
- Category-specific: kitchen products, beauty, supplements, electronics
- Format: Side-by-side images, short video clips
- Distribution: Reddit, Facebook groups, Twitter, YouTube shorts
- **This is the #1 content type.** Visual proof sells better than words.

### Pillar 2: Amazon Listing Education
- "How to create A+ Content that converts"
- "9 image types every Amazon listing needs"
- "Why professional images increase conversion 33%"
- Format: Blog posts (SEO), YouTube tutorials
- Distribution: Organic search, YouTube
- **Positions GreenOnion as authority, captures search traffic**

### Pillar 3: Build-in-Public / Founder Story
- Continue the HN narrative on Twitter/X
- Weekly updates: customer count, learnings, product updates
- "I built an AI tool and got my first 100 customers" narrative arc
- Distribution: Twitter #buildinpublic, IndieHackers, HN
- **Builds personal brand and organic discovery**

### Pillar 4: Customer Stories
- Deep-dive on the "wanted to cry" customer
- "How [seller] saved $X,XXX and Y hours with AI images"
- Video testimonials if possible
- Distribution: Website, YouTube, email marketing
- **Social proof is the #1 missing element right now**

## Content Calendar (First 30 Days)

| Week | Content | Channel |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Add "wanted to cry" testimonial to homepage | Website |

| 4 | Customer case study (if available) | Website, email |
| 4 | Reddit AMA or detailed post in r/FulfillmentByAmazon | Reddit |

## SEO Target Keywords
- "Amazon listing image generator" (low competition)
- "AI Amazon product images" (emerging)
- "A+ Content generator" (medium competition)
- "Amazon product photography AI" (low competition)
- "Amazon listing design tool" (medium competition)
- "bulk Amazon listing images" (low competition)

## Key Content Principle
**Show, don't tell.** Every piece of content should include a real before/after transformation. The product is inherently visual — let the output speak.
