# Cascade Orchestration — Execution Order

## Phase 0.5: Agent Gap Analysis (after seed, before full foundation)
After Company Seed + Founder Research, pause and analyse:
- Given this company's **domain, stage, business model, and ICP**, are there specialist agents we should build that don't exist yet?
- Examples: Regulatory Navigator (fintech/healthtech), Marketplace Dynamics (two-sided platforms), Hardware Go-to-Market (physical products), Fundraising Readiness (pre-raise startups), Community Builder (community-led growth), API/Developer Relations (dev tools), Localisation Strategy (multi-market expansion)
- Output: list of suggested new agents with rationale, or "no gaps — existing agents cover this domain"
- Tom decides whether to build them before proceeding or run with existing agents
- Over time this builds the agent library — each new company type expands what GrowthMind can handle

## Phase 1: Foundation (automated, no founder input needed)
Run in sequence or parallel where noted:
1. **Company Seed Enrichment** — scrape website, fill knowable fields
2. **Founder Research** — LinkedIn, RocketReach, Crunchbase, academic sources (part of seed enrichment now)
3. Run in parallel (+ any new agents built from Phase 0.5):
   - **Market Intel** — market size, competitors, trends
   - **Growth Voice** — brand archetype, messaging pillars, tone
   - **Audience Pulse** — where ICP hangs out, active discussions, signal scoring
   - **Channel Finder** — directories, listings, communities, competitor presence
   - **Domain Expert** — deep industry knowledge: jargon, buying dynamics, ecosystem, what "good" looks like

## Phase 2: Interrogation (DEFAULT — CASCADE STOPS HERE)
4. **Interrogation Agent** — analyse gaps in Company Seed, generate targeted questions
   - Only ask things that are GENUINELY UNKNOWABLE from public sources
   - Founder Research should have already filled: team size, backgrounds, funding (if public), etc.
   - Domain Expert should have already filled: industry context, buying patterns, ecosystem
   - Interrogation focuses on: revenue, pricing, pipeline, deal origins, retention, internal metrics, founder motivation
5. **Deliver questions to Tom IMMEDIATELY via WhatsApp** — do NOT continue past this point
6. **FULL STOP. Tom forwards questions to founder. Wait for answers.**

### ⚠️ THIS IS THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR
- The cascade DOES NOT continue past Phase 2 unless Tom explicitly says so.
- No "pre-interrogation preview" runs. No "we'll just run it at low confidence."
- Interrogation is the checkpoint. Respect it.

### Override: Skip Interrogation
Tom must EXPLICITLY say one of: "run it fully", "skip interrogation", "run pre-interrogation"
- Only then: proceed to Phase 3+ at LOW confidence
- Mark ALL outputs as "pre-interrogation — no founder input"
- Include interrogation questions in the report as "unlock higher confidence"

### Spawn Pattern
- **Spawn 1:** Phase 0.5 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 (generates questions → delivers to Tom → STOPS)
- **Spawn 2:** Phase 3 + Phase 4 + Phase 5 (only after Tom gives the go-ahead — either with answers or explicit skip)

## Phase 3: Core Analysis (after answers received, OR explicit skip from Tom)
7. **Update Company Seed** with founder's answers (if received)
8. Run in parallel:
   - **Growth Pulse** — what's working / what isn't (confidence score)
   - **Strategic Assessment** — demand scorecard, SWOT, verdict, risk flags
   - **Growth Experiments** — prescribed experiments with hypotheses and success criteria
   - **Founder Mirror** — uncomfortable truths, cognitive biases, blind spots
   - **Content Strategist** — topics, formats, distribution, cadence (uses Domain Expert for language)
   - **Outreach Planner** — targets, messaging angles, expected response rates
   - **Competitor Radar** — competitor monitoring, threat assessment, opportunities

## Phase 4: Projections (after core analysis)
9. Run in parallel:
   - **Strategist Brief** — the one thing, 90-day roadmap, channel deep dive
   - **Growth Advisor (catch-all)** — cross-agent pattern detection, anti-patterns, contradictions, meta-insights
10. **Weekly Growth Brief** — first edition, this week's focus + experiment plan
11. **Activity Feed** — timeline of all events and decisions

## Phase 5: Delivery
12. **Growth Diagnosis Report** — client-facing HTML document combining all outputs
13. **Deliver to founder** — via Tom's chosen channel

## Phase 6: Execution Loop (weekly, after initial diagnosis delivered)
14. **Execution Coach** — Monday check-in: did you execute last week's experiments? Binary yes/no.
    - Wednesday nudge if items incomplete
    - Score decay/growth based on execution
    - Streak tracking
    - Outcome collection when experiments marked complete → feeds back into Growth Pulse
15. **Weekly Growth Brief** — regenerated weekly with real execution data
16. **Competitor Radar** refresh (bi-weekly)
17. **Audience Pulse** refresh (bi-weekly)
18. **Content Strategist** refresh (monthly)
19. **Re-diagnosis trigger** — if 3+ weeks of zero execution, or if experiment outcomes suggest pivot needed, trigger partial re-run of Phase 3

## Ongoing Cycle (weekly/bi-weekly after initial diagnosis)
- **Execution Coach** check-in (Monday + Wednesday nudge)
- **Weekly Growth Brief** generation (informed by execution data)
- **Competitor Radar** refresh
- **Audience Pulse** refresh
- **Content Strategist** refresh suggestions
- **Domain Expert** update (if significant industry changes)

## Rules
- **DEFAULT: Cascade STOPS after Phase 2.** Interrogation questions are delivered to Tom. Full stop.
- **Phase 3+ ONLY runs when Tom explicitly says so** — either with founder's answers or an explicit "skip interrogation" override.
- Phase 1 parallel modules can run concurrently after Company Seed + Founder Research complete.
- Phase 3 parallel modules can run concurrently after Company Seed is updated with answers.
- When Tom says "put X through growthmind" — run Phase 0.5 + 1 + 2 ONLY. Deliver interrogation questions. Stop.
- When Tom says "run the full cascade" or "skip interrogation" — run everything, mark as pre-interrogation, lower confidence.

## Spawn Pattern (how growthmind actually executes this)
1. **First spawn:** Phase 0.5 → Phase 1 → Phase 2. Output: foundation data + interrogation questions. Deliver questions to Tom via WhatsApp. DONE.
2. **Tom forwards questions to founder. Waits for answers.**
3. **Second spawn (after answers OR explicit skip):** Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5. Output: full analysis + HTML report.

This two-spawn pattern ensures Tom always sees the interrogation questions before any analysis runs.
