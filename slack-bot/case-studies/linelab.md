## The Company

LineLab builds analytical production system modeling software — the only alternative to discrete event simulation (DES) using MIT-developed extended queueing theory. Their customers include Boeing, Hadrian, GKN Aerospace, and MIT itself. The product delivers results in minutes instead of weeks, with a documented 4.9x ROI and $6M/year in savings for one customer alone.

**Stage:** Early market, crossing the chasm
**Team:** 2 co-founders (US/Germany distributed)
**Demand Score:** 80.5/100
**Verdict:** GO

## What They Thought

Scott and Larissa had every reason to feel confident. MIT-born methodology. Peer-reviewed at the Winter Simulation Conference. Boeing on the customer list. A 91/100 competitive differentiation score — meaning literally no direct competitor exists in their space.

They assumed growth would follow naturally. When you have the best product and Fortune 500 logos, the market should come to you. Right?

## What the Diagnosis Found

Our 18-agent cascade tore through 80+ data points in under 48 hours. The findings weren't what they expected.

### No beachhead — just a trophy case.

LineLab was selling across aerospace, green tech, semiconductors, eVTOL, and advanced manufacturing simultaneously. Five verticals, zero dominance. Every deal was a bespoke pitch to a new industry. The founders knew they were "crossing the chasm" — they'd even used the phrase. But they weren't following the playbook. Geoffrey Moore's entire thesis is that you pick ONE segment and dominate it. LineLab had seven customers across five industries. That's not a beachhead. That's a collection.

> "If you had to pick ONE industry and say no to every opportunity outside it for 18 months — which would it be, and why haven't you done that already?"

That question sat with them for days.

### The MIT rolodex problem.

Every visible customer had a plausible connection to MIT's research network. Boeing is a major MIT partner. Sidewalk Labs has deep MIT ties. The diagnosis flagged this hard: **"Can you close a customer who has never heard of MIT's Advanced Manufacturing program?"** If the answer is no, then what looks like product-market fit is actually network-market fit — and that network will exhaust.

### 58 LinkedIn followers.

A company with Boeing as a customer had less social presence than a local coffee shop. LinkedIn is THE channel for manufacturing decision-makers — VP Engineering types don't browse Product Hunt. They scroll LinkedIn at 6am with their coffee. LineLab was invisible to them.

### Category doesn't exist.

A December 2025 academic review of 9 simulation tools didn't mention LineLab or analytical alternatives. When a VP of Manufacturing Googles "factory simulation software," the search doesn't lead to LineLab. The diagnosis was blunt: **"Stop trying to create 'analytical modeling' as a category. Position as the faster alternative to DES. Anchor to the buyer's existing mental model."**

### Selling the engine, not the destination.

The website led with methodology — "extended queueing theory," "mathematical optimization," "analytical vs Monte Carlo." The diagnosis asked: *"If you removed every mention of 'queueing theory,' 'analytical,' and 'MIT' from your website — would the value proposition still be compelling?"* The answer exposed the gap between what LineLab built and how they talked about it.

### The Autodesk clock.

Autodesk acquired FlexSim in November 2023. DES is consolidating around platforms. The diagnosis gave LineLab a 12–18 month window to establish a beachhead before bundled simulation blurs their differentiation. The moat is methodological — genuinely hard to replicate — but moats don't matter if nobody knows you exist.

## What Happened Next

Scott messaged us within an hour of receiving the report. His words: *"This is the most uncomfortable thing I've ever read about my own company. And I can't argue with any of it."*

Three things changed immediately:

**They picked aerospace.** Not because it was the most exciting vertical — because it was the one where they already had Boeing and GKN as references, the shortest sales cycles, and buyers who attend the same conferences. They turned down two green tech opportunities in the first month. It hurt. It was the right call.

**Scott started posting on LinkedIn.** Three times a week. Not product announcements — real manufacturing insights. The kind of posts that make a VP of Engineering stop scrolling. Within 6 weeks his network grew from 500 to 2,800 connections. Two inbound demo requests came directly from LinkedIn posts — the first deals in LineLab's history that didn't originate from the MIT network.

**They restructured the entire website around outcomes.** The hero section went from methodology jargon to: *"$6M saved. 32% cost avoidance. Answers in minutes, not weeks."* The methodology moved to a "How It Works" page for technical evaluators. Bounce rate dropped 34% in the first month.

Within 90 days of the diagnosis, LineLab had closed two new aerospace customers — neither through MIT connections — and had three more in active POC. They started building a standardised 2-week proof-of-concept playbook so deals could close without the founders running every demo personally.

## The Prescription

Pick aerospace defence. Build 5 referenceable customers in 6 months. Stop chasing green tech startups. Every hour spent on a non-aerospace demo is an hour not spent dominating the one vertical that makes the next 50 deals inevitable.

Restructure messaging around outcomes, not methodology. Lead with the $6M savings and the 4.9x ROI. Save the MIT pedigree for the technical evaluation stage.

Build an inbound engine: LinkedIn thought leadership, gated ROI calculator, vertical-specific content. The goal is simple — close 3 customers in 2026 who found you through content, not connections.

## The Number That Matters

**91/100 competitive differentiation score** — genuinely unique methodology with no direct competitor. The product was never the problem. Distribution was. And now they're fixing it.

## What Scott Said

> "We'd been telling ourselves we were crossing the chasm for a year. The diagnosis showed us we hadn't even picked which chasm to cross. The aerospace focus felt like giving up on opportunity — until we closed two deals in 8 weeks that would have taken 6 months before. The beachhead strategy isn't about limiting yourself. It's about making every conversation easier because the last customer looks exactly like the next one."
