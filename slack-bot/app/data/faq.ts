    question: "Is this just another ChatGPT wrapper?",
    answer:
      "Blunt answer: No. Here's the difference that matters: ChatGPT answers whatever you ask. Growthmind questions whether you're asking the right thing. We start by interrogating your assumptions - your stage, your ICP, your channels - before giving you anything. If we think content marketing is wrong for your stage, we'll tell you to stop, not generate blog posts anyway. We also persist your full business context across sessions - your growth profile, past experiments, what worked, what failed - so every recommendation builds on what came before. ChatGPT forgets everything the moment you close the tab.",

    value: "noproduct",
    question: "What if I don't have product-market fit yet?",
    answer:
      "That's exactly who this is for. Whether you're a founder with zero users or a team with early traction looking to scale — Growthmind meets you where you are. We diagnose your actual stage, identify what channels work for your business, and design focused experiments to test them. You'll know within weeks whether your direction has signal or needs a pivot.",
  },
  {
    value: "trust",
    question: "Can I trust AI to make growth decisions for my business?",
    answer:
      "You're always in control. We operate on a human-in-the-loop model - the AI proposes experiments, drafts content, and recommends next steps, but nothing happens until you approve it. You can edit, reject, or redirect at any point. Think of it as a brutally honest growth advisor who does the research and brings you options. You make the calls.",
  },
  {
    value: "different",
    question: "How is this different from hiring an agency or growth consultant?",
    answer:
      "Agencies charge $10-20k/month and apply the same playbook to every client. They can't afford to tell you 'stop marketing and fix your product first' - their business model requires you to do more. Growthmind costs a fraction of that and actually learns your context - your market, your competitors, your past experiments. It remembers everything. And it has zero incentive to recommend tactics you don't need.",
  },
  {
    value: "time",
    question: "How much time does this actually take?",
    answer:
      "Your first session takes about 10 minutes. The AI does most of the heavy lifting - researching your market, competitors, and positioning - then asks you targeted questions based on what it finds. After that, each weekly experiment cycle takes roughly 2-3 hours of your time: reviewing the AI's diagnosis, approving the experiment plan, and reviewing the results. The AI handles the research, asset creation, and analysis. You focus on the decisions that matter.",
  },
  {
    value: "interrogation",
    question: "Why 'Interrogation-First'? Sounds intense.",
    answer:
      "Because every other AI tool says 'just ask me anything!' and then gives generic advice because it doesn't know your context. We flip that. Before we give you anything, we ask you 20+ hard questions about your business, market, competitors, and past experiments. It feels like a tough investor grilling you - because that's how we learn what actually matters for your growth. Generic advice is free on Reddit. Personalised strategy requires deep understanding.",
  },
  {
    value: "pricing",
    question: "Why are you transparent about pricing?",
    answer:
      "Because we hate 'Contact Sales' as much as you do. You have a budget and you need to know if this fits. Starter is $20/mo, Growth is $200/mo. No hidden fees, no 'enterprise pricing' games. If you can't afford it yet, start with the free assessment and see if the insights alone are worth it.",
