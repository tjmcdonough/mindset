## The Company

Qala builds source-level data observability and compliance infrastructure — real-time governance that works at the code level, not periodic snapshots like the incumbents.

**Stage:** Pre-seed, €1.7M raised
**Team:** 3 co-founders (all ex-Imburse Payments, acquired by Duck Creek Technologies)
**Industry:** Data governance / compliance infrastructure

## What They Thought

They had a technically differentiated product (real-time source-level governance vs competitors' periodic snapshots), a strong founding team who previously built and exited a payments company, and massive regulatory tailwinds from DORA and the EU AI Act.

## What the Diagnosis Found

### The website says everything and nothing.
CTAs are "Book a demo" with no signup flow, no public pricing, and no visible customers. The trust vacuum is the #1 growth blocker. At pre-seed with no customer logos, the site needs to work 10x harder — and it reads like enterprise software boilerplate.

### No founder story anywhere.
Three co-founders who built and sold a payments company — and the website is completely impersonal. The Imburse origin story (what compliance nightmare made them build Qala?) is their strongest trust signal. It's missing entirely.

### White space in source-level governance.
Every major competitor (Collibra at $5.5B valuation, BigID at $1.25B, OneTrust at $4.5B) uses scan-based or periodic snapshot approaches. Qala's real-time, source-level model is genuinely different — but the messaging doesn't make this distinction visceral. Buyers can't tell Qala apart from the incumbents.

### Regulatory timing is perfect — if they move.
DORA went live January 2025. EU AI Act is phasing in. The data classification market is growing at 35.1% CAGR. But it's unclear if prospects are coming inbound from regulatory panic or if Qala is still educating the market. This determines the entire GTM playbook.

### Targeting everyone in regulated industries.
Fintech, SaaS, healthtech, SMEs — the positioning is too broad for a team of 3. The beachhead question (200-person Swiss fintech vs 50-person healthtech?) is unanswered.

## The Prescription

Lead with the Imburse story. Make the source-level vs snapshot distinction the centrepiece of every piece of content. Pick one vertical (European fintech under DORA pressure is the obvious candidate). And get a real customer — even a design partner at reduced price — because at pre-seed, one logo changes everything.

## The Number That Matters

**$20-30B combined TAM** across data observability, governance, and classification by 2030. Qala's serviceable market is $1-2B. The opportunity is enormous — but only if they can articulate why they're different from the $5.5B incumbents.
